        <p>
            Before its <em>errata</em> in september 2019, <em>Pentex</em> was played in over half of tournament decks
            and it was the most played card overall. It used to prevent the target minion from acting too,
            and that made it the most versatile card of the game.
            In the endgame its power is still worthwhile though: disabling a specific minion of the prey
            can be key to victory.

            Loved for its ubiquitousness, the <em>Dreams</em> provides either two pool

            in critical moments by drawing two cards.

            it is similar to <span class="card" onclick="dC('blooddoll')">Blood Doll</span>.
            Both enable a 1 point leech per turn and allow to give some blood back to a thirsty vampire,
            which can avoid hunt actions and keep <a href="../../strategy/fundamentals.html#ABC">ABC</a> high.
            <em>Vessel</em> cost is higher: it takes a full turn to kick in and costs 1 pool, making it 2 pool less efficient,

            Before its <em>errata</em> in 2018, it permitted to take back as much blood as desired

            The <em>errata</em> made <span class="card" onclick="dC('miniontap')">Minion Tap</span> relevant again,

            The ability to cancel any minion card is extremely valuable.

            A good bloat device that generates one pool per turn at no cost. It is a no-brainer in decks able to

            A good permanent intercept card at a decent price, it can even be used to help another player.
            As it is <em>Unique</em>, other locations can be included along it to improve intercept,
            in order of frequency

            A nice tool for <em>powerbleed</em> constructs, it helps to get bleeds through when one has no stealth.
            Although a bit expansive, it is often a key card for the lunge in such decks.

            An excellent bloat device, its side-effect of card discard can be a bummer, as many
            decks rely on the fact that even just 2 exemplaries of a given card are enough to draw it at some point
            in the game. However, used in conjunction with

            An excellent device for combat-oriented decks. Broader than a rush action like
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('bumsrush')">Bum's Rush</span>, it lets all the minions rush the target.
            This is a good way to quickly overwhelm a defensive module, plus it will take an action to remove,
            slowing the opponent. A good addition to <span class="card" onclick="dC('fame')">Fame</span>.

            An good bloat device, it helps to get multiple big capacity vampires out at a reasonnable cost.
            Even better with crypt accelerators like

            <span class="card" onclick="dC('informationhighway')">Information Highway</span>,
