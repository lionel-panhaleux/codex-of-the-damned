{% call layout.card_column("Pentexâ„¢ Subversion", decks=1323, copies="1-2") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
Before its <em>errata</em> in September 2020, <em>Pentex</em> was played in over half of
tournament decks and it was the most played card overall. It used to prevent the target
minion from acting too, and that made it the most versatile card of the game.
In the endgame its power is still worthwhile though: disabling a specific minion of the
prey can be key to victory.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Dreams of the Sphinx", decks=1138, copies="1-3") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
Loved for its ubiquitousness, the <em>Dreams</em> provides either two pool
(and can even accelerate the setup if played early) or help the deck rotation in
critical moments by drawing two cards.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Giant's Blood", decks=984, copies="1") %}
{% trans trimmed golconda_inner_peace=card("Golconda: Inner Peace") %}
Even if it is only once per game, it brings more blood on the table than any other card,
with the notable exception of {{ golconda_inner_peace }}. It is often played in a single
copy: with a bit of luck it brings a definitive advantage, otherwise it prevents an
opponent to play it himself.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Vessel", decks=868, copies="2-4") %}
{% trans trimmed
leeching=link("/strategy/bloat", _("leeching"), _anchor="leeching"),
blood_doll=card("Blood Doll"),
a_b=link("/strategy/fundamentals", _("A&B"), _anchor="AB")
%}
The most played {{ leeching }} card, it is similar to {{ blood_doll }}. Both enable a
1 point leech per turn and allow to give some blood back to a thirsty vampire, which can
avoid hunt actions and keep {{ a_b }} high. <em>Vessel</em> cost is higher: it takes a
full turn to kick in and costs 1 pool, making it 2 pool less efficient, but it cannot be
destroyed and it is a <em>Trifle</em>.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Villein", decks=788, copies="3-7") %}
{% trans trimmed minion_tap=card("Minion Tap") %}
Before its <em>errata</em> in 2018, it permitted to take back as much blood as desired
from the target vampire with no upper limit. Its <em>Trifle</em> trait made it one of
the best leech option, besting {{ minion_tap }}. The <em>errata</em> made
{{ minion_tap }} relevant again, although only when getting more than 5 blood from a
vampire is relevant.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Direct Intervention", decks=715, copies="1-2") %}
{% trans trimmed
wall_decks=link("/strategy/archetypes", _("wall decks"), _anchor="wall"),
block_denial=link("/strategy/fundamentals", _("block denial"), _anchor="stealth-and-intercept")
%}
The ability to cancel any minion card is extremely valuable. It has reliable role in
{{ wall_decks }} to deal with {{ block_denial }}, otherwise its value varies depending
on how good a player is at assessing the importance of cards.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Information Highway", decks=566, copies="1-3") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
An excellent crypt accelerator at no cost, it is played both with big capacity crypts,
but also with weenie crypts at 1-2 capacity to make it possible to draw and get out a
vampire in a single turn. Even if it is <em>Unique</em>, some decks include it in
multiple copies to improve their chances to draw it early on.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Blood Doll", decks=558, copies="2-5") %}
{% trans trimmed vessel=card("Vessel") %}
Similar to {{ vessel }} in its effect, it is not a <em>Trifle</em>, so it does not fit
in all decks depending on the number of Master cards. Even if it can be destroyed by a
{{ vessel }}, it is immediately usable when played and costs zero pool.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Powerbase: Montreal", decks=504, copies="1") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
A good bloat device that generates one pool per turn at no cost. It is a no-brainer in
decks able to defend it. It can also be a useful bargaining chip when dealing with
other Methusalahs, as it can easily be borrowed as part of a deal.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Wider View", decks=475, copies="1-2") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
A cheap <em>Trifle</em> that provides rotation to the crypt. For a lot of crypts, this
is a useful asset in the mid game to help fetch a third vampire. It is even guaranteed
to generate one pool at some point.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Fame", decks=423, copies="1-2") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
A key card for combat heavy decks, usually used on the prey's minions, it provides
excellent pool damage. The fact that it is <em>Unique</em> means it can not easily be
abused, though.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Archon Investigation", decks=411, copies="1-2") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
A dreadful deterrent against too powerful bleeders. A must have for decks who do not
have access to bounces, it can be included in virtually any deck just to discourage the
6-7 bleed scores {{ dom }} or {{ pre }} can achieve.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Wash", decks=391, copies="1-3") %}
{% trans trimmed villein=card("Villein") %}
Countering Master cards is often useful: the best move is to counter a bloat card like
{{ villein }}, which is equivalent to a serious bleed. Other powerful Master cards can
be countered this way too.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Jake Washington", decks=367, copies="1-3") %}
{% trans trimmed
war_ghoul=card("War Ghoul"),
khazar_s_diary=card("Khazar's Diary (Endless Night)", "Khazar's Diary")
%}
A good way to bring back some blood on a vampire, it can also provide protection by
blocking an action and is a key combination with {{ war_ghoul }} and
{{ khazar_s_diary }}.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("The Parthenon", decks=355, copies="1-4") %}
{% trans trimmed
anson=card("Anson"),
nana_buruku=card("Nana Buruku"),
cybele=card("Cybele"),
huitzilopochtli=card("Huitzilopochtli"),
isanwayen=card("Isanwayen")
%}
A useful tool as it enables the play of more Master cards at no cost, it can be combined
with vampires providing yet another Master action: {{ anson }}, {{ nana_buruku }},
{{ cybele }}, {{ huitzilopochtli }} or {{ isanwayen }}.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Perfectionist", decks=350, copies="1-3") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
An easy way to get some pool back on a vampire at no cost. Many actions go through
unblocked and unreacted to, so it tends to bring a pool back on the vampire at least
every other turn.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("The Rack", decks=339, copies="1") %}
{% trans trimmed
blood_doll=card("Blood Doll"),
vessel=card("Vessel")
%}
One of the best tool available to bring some blood back on a vampire, it works
beautifully with {{ blood_doll }} or {{ vessel }}. It needs to be defended to be kept in
play, but such a good blood generator at no cost is a bargain.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Monastery of Shadows", decks=333, copies="1") %}
{% trans trimmed parity_shift=card("Parity Shift") %}
A costly but efficient location. The stealth can make the difference between life or
death for the prey, and the bonus hand size is nothing to frown upon. It is a little bit
better in decks using {{ parity_shift }} as it can get the pool down just enough to be
able to play the vote against one's prey.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Sudden Reversal", decks=325, copies="1-3") %}
{% trans trimmed wash=card("Wash") %}
Very similar to {{ wash }}, it is not a <em>Trifle</em> but, on the other hand, it does
not let the target play another Master, so it is a bit more efficient for stopping a
bloat. So, if there is room for a full fledged Master in the deck, it is a marginally
better option.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("The Coven", decks=299, copies="1") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
A good way to bring some blood back on the table, is it a useful tool against rush and
grinder decks. Even if it does not come along so often, the fact that it helps the whole
table can really slow down these particular archetypes.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Ashur Tablets", decks=294, copies="6-12") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
It is a decent bloating device but its key ability is to allow some recursion in the
deck. Played in conjunction with some cards adding Master actions, it becomes
tremendously efficient. Decks that use it typically include a dozen of them, but getting
over 20 copies is not unheard of.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Anarch Troublemaker", decks=287, copies="1-2") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
A powerful tool for <em>powerbleed</em> constructs. Its ability to destroy an equipment
can be useful, but it is mostly included for its ability to lock vampires, and it is a
key card for bleed decks without stealth.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Secure Haven", decks=277, copies="1-2") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
Although <em>Unique</em>, it is a solid counter against rush decks. Other options are
required to really defend against them as this can only protect one vampire, but
this is still a vampire one would not take down easily.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Smiling Jack, The Anarch", decks=269, copies="1-2") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
This is a good damage dealing option for <em>wall</em> decks. As they tend to be low on
pool damage, this helps them ousting the table in timely fashion.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Golconda: Inner Peace", decks=252, copies="1-3") %}
{% trans trimmed minion_tap=card("Minion Tap") %}
Although loosing a vampire is a steep price to pay, this is the highest bloat possible.
Played on a 10 or 11 capacity vampire, that's a lot of pool, moreover if
{{ minion_tap }} has been played on the vampire the turn before. It can also often be
played for 2 pool damages on the prey.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Zillah's Valley", decks=230, copies="3-7") %}
{% trans trimmed
villein=card("Villein"),
minion_tap=card("Minion Tap"),
parity_shift=card("Parity Shift")
%}
An excellent crypt accelerator provided one has big capacity vampires and enough pool to
use it. It is a very good combination with {{ villein }} or {{ minion_tap }}, but also
helps get some pool out fast to play a {{ parity_shift }} on one's prey.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("The Barrens", decks=205, copies="1") %}
{% trans trimmed dreams_of_the_sphinx=card("Dreams of the Sphinx") %}
Although not as versatile as {{ dreams_of_the_sphinx }}, it is a good additional tool to
help card rotation at no cost.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("KRCG News Radio", decks=205, copies="1") %}
{% trans trimmed
wrmh_talk_radio=card("WMRH Talk Radio"),
channel_10=card("Channel 10"),
the_rumor_mill=card("The Rumor Mill, Tabloid Newspaper", "The Rumor Mill"),
wall_street_night=card("Wall Street Night, Financial Newspaper", "Wall Street Night")
%}
A good permanent intercept card at a decent price, it can even be used to help another
player. As it is <em>Unique</em>, other locations can be included along it to improve
intercept, in order of frequency {{ wrmh_talk_radio }}, {{ channel_10 }},
{{ the_rumor_mill }} and {{ wall_street_night }}.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Misdirection", decks=172, copies="1-2") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
A nice tool for <em>powerbleed</em> decks, it helps to get bleeds through when one has
no stealth. Although a bit expensive, it is often a key card for the lunge in such
decks.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Liquidation", decks=171, copies="3-7") %}
{% trans trimmed
ashur_tablets=card("Ashur Tablets"),
emerald_legionnaire=card("Emerald Legionnaire"),
sudario_refraction=card("Sudario Refraction")
%}
An excellent bloat device, its discarding side-effect can be a bummer, as many
decks rely on the fact that even just 2 exemplaries of a given card are enough to draw
it at some point in the game. However, used in conjunction with {{ ashur_tablets }},
{{ emerald_legionnaire }} or {{ sudario_refraction }}, it becomes invaluable.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Haven Uncovered", decks=170, copies="1-4") %}
{% trans trimmed
bum_s_rush=card("Bum's Rush"),
fame=card("Fame")
%}
An excellent device for combat-oriented decks. Broader than a rush action like
{{ bum_s_rush }}, it lets all the minions rush the target. This is a good way to quickly
overwhelm a defensive module, plus it will take an action to remove, slowing the
opponent. A good addition to {{ fame }}.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Minion Tap", decks=162, copies="1-6") %}
{% trans trimmed
zillah_s_valley=card("Zillah's Valley"),
information_highway=card("Information Highway"),
villein=card("Villein")
%}
An good bloat device, it helps to get multiple big capacity vampires out at a
reasonnable cost. Even better with crypt accelerators like {{ zillah_s_valley }} and
{{ information_highway }}, it has long been outclassed by {{ villein }}, until the
<em>errata</em> of 2018 setting an upper limit of 5 blood.
