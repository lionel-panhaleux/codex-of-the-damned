{% call layout.card_column("Villein", decks=557, copies="2-6") %}
{% trans trimmed
minion_tap=card("Minion Tap"),
vessel=card("Vessel"),
blood_doll=card("Blood Doll")
%}
Its <em>Trifle</em> trait made it one of the best leech option overall,
besting {{ minion_tap }} and often slower tools like {{ vessel }} or {{ blood_doll }}.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Dreams of the Sphinx", decks=531, copies="1-3") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
Loved for its ubiquitousness, the <em>Dreams</em> provides either two pool
(and can even accelerate the setup if played early) or help the deck rotation in
critical moments by drawing two cards.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Vessel", decks=868, copies="2-4") %}
{% trans trimmed
leeching=link("/strategy/bloat", _("leeching"), _anchor="leeching"),
blood_doll=card("Blood Doll"),
a_b=link("/strategy/fundamentals", _("A&B"), _anchor="AB")
%}
The most played {{ leeching }} card after the ubiquitous {{ villein }},
it enables a 1 point leech per turn and allows to give some blood back to a vampire,
which can avoid hunt actions and keep {{ a_b }} high. {{ blood_doll }} is cheaper
and faster, but it can be destroyed and it is not a <em>Trifle</em>.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Wider View", decks=374, copies="1-2") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
A cheap <em>Trifle</em> that provides rotation to the crypt. For a lot of crypts, this
is a useful asset in the mid game to help fetch a third vampire. It is even guaranteed
to generate one pool at some point.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Giant's Blood", decks=367, copies="1") %}
{% trans trimmed golconda_inner_peace=card("Golconda: Inner Peace") %}
Even if it is only once per game, it brings more blood on the table than any other card,
with the notable exception of {{ golconda_inner_peace }}. It is often played in a single
copy: with a bit of luck it brings a definitive advantage, otherwise it prevents an
opponent to play it himself.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Direct Intervention", decks=328, copies="1-2") %}
{% trans trimmed
wall_decks=link("/strategy/archetype-categories", _("wall decks"), _anchor="wall"),
block_denial=link("/strategy/fundamentals", _("block denial"), _anchor="stealth-and-intercept")
%}
The ability to cancel any minion card is extremely valuable. It has reliable role in
{{ wall_decks }} to deal with {{ block_denial }}, otherwise its value varies depending
on how good a player is at assessing the importance of cards.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Powerbase: Montreal", decks=297, copies="1") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
A good bloat device that generates one pool per turn at no cost. It is a no-brainer in
decks able to defend it. It can also be a useful bargaining chip when dealing with
other Methusalahs, as it can easily be borrowed as part of a deal.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Pentexâ„¢ Subversion", decks=294, copies="1-2") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
Before its <em>errata</em> in September 2020, <em>Pentex</em> was the most played Master
card in all decks. It is still powerful though: disabling a specific minion of the
prey can be key to victory in many decks.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Information Highway", decks=282, copies="1-3") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
An excellent crypt accelerator at no cost, it is played both with big capacity crypts,
but also with weenie crypts at 1-2 capacity to make it possible to draw and get out a
vampire in a single turn. Even if it is <em>Unique</em>, some decks include it in
multiple copies to improve their chances to draw it early on.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("The Coven", decks=179, copies="1") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
A good way to bring some blood back on the table, is it a useful tool against rush and
grinder decks. Even if it does not come along so often, the fact that it helps the whole
table can really slow down these particular archetypes.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("The Rack", decks=176, copies="1") %}
{% trans trimmed
blood_doll=card("Blood Doll"),
vessel=card("Vessel")
%}
One of the best tool available to bring some blood back on a vampire, it works
beautifully with {{ blood_doll }} or {{ vessel }}. It needs to be defended to be kept in
play, but such a good blood generator at no cost is a bargain.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("The Parthenon", decks=175, copies="1-4") %}
{% trans trimmed
anson=card("Anson"),
nana_buruku=card("Nana Buruku"),
cybele=card("Cybele"),
huitzilopochtli=card("Huitzilopochtli"),
isanwayen=card("Isanwayen")
%}
A useful tool as it enables the play of more Master cards at no cost, it can be combined
with vampires providing yet another Master action: {{ anson }}, {{ nana_buruku }},
{{ cybele }}, {{ huitzilopochtli }} or {{ isanwayen }}.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Archon Investigation", decks=173, copies="1-2") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
A dreadful deterrent against too powerful bleeders. A must have for decks who do not
have access to bounces, it can be included in virtually any deck just to discourage the
6-7 bleed scores {{ dom }} or {{ pre }} can achieve.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Fame", decks=423, copies="1-2") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
A key card for combat heavy decks, usually used on the prey's minions, it provides
excellent pool damage. The fact that it is <em>Unique</em> means it can not easily be
abused, though.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Monastery of Shadows", decks=171, copies="1") %}
{% trans trimmed parity_shift=card("Parity Shift") %}
A costly but efficient location. The stealth can make the difference between life or
death for the prey, and the bonus hand size is nothing to frown upon. It is a little bit
better in decks using {{ parity_shift }} as it can get the pool down just enough to be
able to play the vote against one's prey.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Ashur Tablets", decks=170, copies="6-12") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
It is a decent bloating device but its key ability is to allow some recursion in the
deck. Played in conjunction with some cards adding Master actions, it becomes
tremendously efficient. Since its nerf in 2024, it is played in less copies overall,
since you can only play one per turn.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Smiling Jack, The Anarch", decks=147, copies="1-2") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
This is a good damage dealing option for <em>wall</em> decks. As they tend to be low on
pool damage, this helps them ousting the table in timely fashion.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Jake Washington", decks=147, copies="1-2") %}
{% trans trimmed
war_ghoul=card("War Ghoul")
%}
A good way to bring back some blood on a vampire, it can also provide protection by
blocking an action and is a key combination with {{ war_ghoul }}.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Secure Haven", decks=128, copies="1-2") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
Although <em>Unique</em>, it is a solid counter against rush decks. Other options are
required to really defend against them as this can only protect one vampire, but
this is still a vampire one would not take down easily.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Wash", decks=121, copies="1-2") %}
{% trans trimmed villein=card("Villein") %}
Countering Master cards is often useful: the best move is to counter a bloat card like
{{ villein }}, which is equivalent to a serious bleed. Other powerful Master cards can
be countered this way too.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Anarch Troublemaker", decks=113, copies="1-2") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
A powerful tool for <em>powerbleed</em> constructs. Its ability to destroy an equipment
can be useful, but it is mostly included for its ability to lock vampires, and it is a
key card for bleed decks without stealth.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Zillah's Valley", decks=106, copies="3-7") %}
{% trans trimmed
villein=card("Villein"),
minion_tap=card("Minion Tap"),
parity_shift=card("Parity Shift")
%}
An excellent crypt accelerator provided one has big capacity vampires and enough pool to
use it. It is a very good combination with {{ villein }}, but also
helps get some pool out fast to play a {{ parity_shift }} on one's prey.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Perfectionist", decks=105, copies="1-2") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
An easy way to get some pool back on a vampire at no cost. Many actions go through
unblocked and unreacted to, so it tends to bring a pool back on the vampire at least
every other turn.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("The Barrens", decks=105, copies="1") %}
{% trans trimmed dreams_of_the_sphinx=card("Dreams of the Sphinx") %}
Although not as versatile as {{ dreams_of_the_sphinx }}, it is a good additional tool to
help card rotation at no cost.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Blood Doll", decks=104, copies="1-4") %}
{% trans trimmed vessel=card("Vessel") %}
Similar to {{ vessel }} in its effect, it is not a <em>Trifle</em>, so it does not fit
in all decks depending on the number of Master cards. Even if it can be destroyed by a
{{ vessel }}, it is immediately usable when played and costs zero pool.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Liquidation", decks=87, copies="4-8") %}
{% trans trimmed
ashur_tablets=card("Ashur Tablets"),
emerald_legionnaire=card("Emerald Legionnaire"),
sudario_refraction=card("Sudario Refraction")
%}
A good bloat device, its discard effect is a bummer.
However, used in conjunction with {{ ashur_tablets }} or {{ sudario_refraction }},
it becomes bearable. Its use has declined since the {{ emerald_legionnaire }} nerf in 2024.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Sudden Reversal", decks=86, copies="1-2") %}
{% trans trimmed wash=card("Wash") %}
Similar to {{ wash }}, it is not a <em>Trifle</em> but, on the other hand, it does
not let the target play another Master, so it is a bit more efficient for stopping a
bloat.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Papillon", decks=83, copies="1") %}
{% trans trimmed hunting_ground=card("Academic Hunting Ground", "Hunting Ground") %}
Basically a better {{ hunting_ground }} for those relying heavily on Princes, Barons
or Archbishops. Definitely worth including when the crypt fits.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Metro Underground", decks=61, copies="1") %}
{% trans trimmed
a_b=link("/strategy/fundamentals", _("A&B"), _anchor="AB"),
deflection=card("Deflection")
%}
A considerable {{ a_b }} enhancer, the 1 pool cost can be worth it, especially if the
vampire so unlocked can bounce some bleeds away with {{ deflection }}.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Golconda: Inner Peace", decks=61, copies="1-2") %}
{% trans trimmed minion_tap=card("Minion Tap") %}
Although loosing a vampire is a steep price to pay, this is the highest bloat possible.
Played on a 10 or 11 capacity vampire, that's a lot of pool, moreover if
{{ minion_tap }} has been played on the vampire the turn before. It can also be
played for pool damage on the prey.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Creepshow Casino", decks=60, copies="1") %}
{% trans trimmed minion_tap=card("Minion Tap") %}
A nice stealth enhancer, especially useful for political decks.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Dabbler", decks=58, copies="2-4") %}
{% trans trimmed
the_platinum_protocol=card("The Platinum Protocol"),
break_the_bonds=card("Break the Bonds")
%}
Previously reserved to very nich builds, it knows a growing success with the arrival
of in-clan "three-ways" like {{ the_platinum_protocol }} or {{ break_the_bonds }}.
The blood or unlock choice is very adaptable.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("KRCG News Radio", decks=58, copies="1") %}
{% trans trimmed
wrmh_talk_radio=card("WMRH Talk Radio"),
channel_10=card("Channel 10"),
the_rumor_mill=card("The Rumor Mill, Tabloid Newspaper", "The Rumor Mill"),
wall_street_night=card("Wall Street Night, Financial Newspaper", "Wall Street Night")
%}
A good permanent intercept card at a decent price, it can even be used to help another
player. As it is <em>Unique</em>, other locations can be included along it to improve
intercept, in order of frequency {{ wrmh_talk_radio }}, {{ channel_10 }},
{{ the_rumor_mill }} and {{ wall_street_night }}.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Heidelberg Castle, Germany", decks=56, copies="1-2") %}
{% trans trimmed puppet_master=card("Puppet Master") %}
A unique effect, exceptional when stealing opposing vampires with {{ puppet_master }}
or similar cards, but also worth it just for using some key equipments or retainers like
bleed enhancers multiple times per turn.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Effective Management", decks=55, copies="1-5") %}
{% trans trimmed
information_highway=card("Information Highway")
%}
A must-have in fast-paced builds aiming at influencing more than 4 vampires, often seen
alongside {{ information_highway }}.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Haven Uncovered", decks=51, copies="1-5") %}
{% trans trimmed
bum_s_rush=card("Bum's Rush"),
fame=card("Fame")
%}
Broader than a rush action like {{ bum_s_rush }}, it lets all the minions rush the target.
This is a good way to overwhelm a defensive module, plus it takes an action to remove,
slowing down the opponent. A good addition to {{ fame }}.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}
