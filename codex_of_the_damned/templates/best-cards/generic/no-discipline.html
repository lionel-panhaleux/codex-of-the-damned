<h1>{{ _("No discipline") }}</h1>

{% call layout.card_column("On the Qui Vive", decks=510, copies="2-4") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
Wake reaction cards are played in most decks.
This one has no requirement, no cost and is immediately replaced, plus it can be used by
allies. However, it may need to be complemented by other wakes because of its once per
turn limit.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Heart of Nizchetus", decks=299, copies="1-2") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
A cheap way to ensure an optimal card rotation throughout the game. It has no direct
effect on the table so it is often overlooked, even though the fluidity it confers is
a sure path to victory.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Delaying Tactics", decks=266, copies="1-3") %}
{% trans trimmed consanguineous_boon=card("Consanguineous Boon") %}
A very widespread defence against political actions. The action can still be performed
again a turn later, but breaking a predator's lunge or preventing a prey's
{{ consanguineous_boon }} can make a win. It is best used <em>after</em> the vote has
taken place.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Taste of Vitae", decks=180, copies="3-6") %}
{% trans trimmed
minion_tap=card("Minion Tap"),
blood_doll=card("Blood Doll")
%}
An excellent tool for bloating, it is often seen in rush decks. Played efficiently, it
helps leech with cards like {{ minion_tap }} or {{ blood_doll }}.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Carlton Van Wyk", decks=163, copies="1") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
By far the most played ally of the game, he is an excellent blocker for a cheap price.
An excellent addition in virtually any deck. Its combat ability makes him quite hard to
take down and his existence alone is a deterrent to diablery, as he can be put into play
to destroy the diabolist the next turn.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Enkil Cog", decks=158, copies="1-3") %}
{% trans trimmed archon_investigation=card("Archon Investigation") %}
A permanent bleed boost at no cost, it allows acting during other players turns:
at the end of the predator turn to stay unlocked, or during the prey turn to bleed hard
whithout fear of {{ archon_investigation }}. With a way to unlock the vampire,
it lets a minion bleed twice in consecutive turns.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Ivory Bow", decks=133, copies="1") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
It provides a deadly aggravated strike at any range for just one pool and is therefore
the most cost-effective weapon of the game. Any deck expecting actual combat can play
it.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("The Unmasking", decks=107, copies="1-3") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
A key card to ally-oriented decks, it transforms any ally setup into a very cumbersome
wall. An overall intercept bonus at no cost is already good, plus being an event makes
it hard to remove from the table.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Aranthebes, The Immortal", decks=96, copies="1") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
A cheap permanent intercept device, although affecting only the predator. As a bonus,
it can have a devastative effect against weenie constructs.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Mr. Winthrop", decks=95, copies="1") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
Permanent intercept bonus at no cost, it is a good addition in any deck packing a
defensive module with some intercept.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column(".44 Magnum", decks=90, copies="1-6") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
The optional maneuver make it a cost-efficient option when it comes to weapons. It is
often combined with {{ cel }} for maximum efficiency as it is not limited to a
single strike per round or combat: additional strikes transform this weapon into a real
tool of destruction.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Sniper Rifle", decks=90, copies="1-3") %}
{% trans trimmed grinding=link("/strategy/combat", _("grinding"), _anchor="posture") %}
An excellent option for decks with good intercept capabilities, it makes blocks more
threatening and keep closed combat modules at range, excellent for {{ grinding }}.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Scourge of the Enochians", decks=88, copies="1") %}
{% trans trimmed the_embrace=card("The Embrace") %}
A death sentence for breed decks at no cost, it is often included in slow decks that
have difficulties to cope with the overwhelming numbers of minions produced by decks
creating newborn vampires with cards like {{ the_embrace }}.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Target Vitals", decks=85, copies="3-7") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
An excellent combat option, it usually gets through against deck with no heavy combat
module. A single aggravated damage can even become three and burn a vampire. Because any
minion can use it, it is also included in ally oriented decks.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Narrow Minds", decks=75, copies="1") %}
{% trans trimmed
deflection=card("Deflection"),
telepathic_misdirection=card("Telepathic Misdirection")
%}
An easy way to hinder bounce defense relying on cards like {{ deflection }} or
{{ telepathic_misdirection }}, especially for those who do not bounce themselves.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Mylan Horseed", decks=70, copies="1") %}
{% trans trimmed
a_b=link("/strategy/fundamentals", _("A&B"), _anchor="AB")
%}
Played in decks with non-Camarilla big capacity vampires, it is a straight-up boost in
{{ a_b }} for just one pool. Hard to block and hard to destroy in combat, he is safe in
many situations.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("FBI Special Affairs Division", decks=54, copies="1") %}
{% trans trimmed the_unmasking=card("The Unmasking") %}
It is a good deterrent and help keep allies alive, but is only worth playing if the
allies have a good chance to block vampires and is therefore always accompanied by
{{ the_unmasking }}.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Forced Awakening", decks=54, copies="1-4") %}
{% trans trimmed
on_the_qui_vive=card("On the Qui Vive"),
wake_with_evening_s_freshness=card("Wake with Evening's Freshness")
%}
Yet another wake, this one is replaced but can cost a bit of blood. It can be a good
complement or alternative to {{ on_the_qui_vive }} and
{{ wake_with_evening_s_freshness }}.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Concealed Weapon", decks=52, copies="3-8") %}
{% trans trimmed magnum=card(".44 Magnum") %}
An excellent way to get a weapon without risking an action that could be blocked, it is
most often associated with {{ magnum }}.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Kevlar Vest", decks=51, copies="1") %}
{% trans trimmed
magnum=card(".44 Magnum"),
sniper_rifle=card("Sniper Rifle")
%}
A nice defensive equipment, particularly efficient against {{ magnum }} and {{ sniper_rifle }},
the two most widespread weapons.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Dragonbound", decks=51, copies="1") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
A good tool for pool damage for combat-oriented decks. The hand size diminution is
acceptable if it means dealing 2 or 3 damages per turn to the prey. However, it can have
detrimental effects on cross-table allies if played carelessly.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Wake with Evening's Freshness", decks=46, copies="1-4") %}
{% trans trimmed on_the_qui_vive=card("On the Qui Vive") %}
Although only usable by a vampire and not replaced until the next turn, it has the
advantage to be playable multiple times, so it is a good complement to the more common
{{ on_the_qui_vive }}.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Bum's Rush", decks=44, copies="1-6") %}
{% trans trimmed deep_song=card("Deep Song") %}
The eponymous card of <em>rush</em> decks, it allows for direct combat against any
minion, with the nice bonus of a maneuver to control the range a bit. Some disciplines
have better alternatives, like {{ ani }} with {{ deep_song }}, but otherwise it is a
go-to card for combat-oriented decks.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("The Uncoiling", decks=36, copies="1") %}
{% trans trimmed
the_unmasking =card("The Unmasking"),
scourge_of_the_enochians = card("Scourge of the Enochians")
%}
A neat inclusion when the most widespread events {{ scourge_of_the_enochians }} or
{{ the_unmasking }} are very detrimental to the deck.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Ossian", decks=36, copies="1") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
He is a good rusher open to all decks. Hard to block, he can pick his targets for
maximum effects. Starting with 4 life, he often goes up to more. His ability lets him
dispose of young vampire without good defensive options: a little pricey to be just a
buffer in front of a rush deck, he becomes invaluable against weenie decks.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Weighted Walking Stick", decks=35, copies="3-6") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
An efficient weapon at no cost, requiring no action to equip, it is a good alternative
for toolbox decks not much specialized in combat. Often played in association with
{{ for }} for damage prevention.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Sport Bike", decks=33, copies="1-2") %}
{% trans trimmed
mr_winthrop=card("Mr. Winthrop"),
bowl_of_convergence=card("Bowl of Convergence"),
raven_spy=card("Raven Spy")
%}
Free permanent intercept for anyone, its 1 pool cost makes it less desireable than {{ mr_winthrop }}
or {{ bowl_of_convergence }}, but it is not unique and can add yet another source of intercept
for those who do not have {{ ani }} for {{ raven_spy }}.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("The Bitter and Sweet Story", decks=31, copies="1") %}
{% trans trimmed
bleed=link("/strategy/archetype-categories", _("Bleed"), _anchor="bleed")
%}
A good inclusion for fast-paced {{ bleed }} decks, when one can count on being the first Methuselah to benefit from it.
It can provide just the additional steam one needs to finish a table.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}
