<h1>{{ aus }} {{ _("Auspex") }}</h1>
<div class="insert tip">
    <p>
        {% trans trimmed %}
        {{ aus }} provides the best intercept in the game, plus the
        ability to bounce bleeds. It makes for an excellent defence.
        {% endtrans %}
    </p>
</div>

{% call layout.card_column("Telepathic Misdirection", decks=257, copies="3-7") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
By far the most played card in {{ aus }}, it is an excellent
bounce. Its blood cost is fair and its basic effect can
still be useful if the table context does not mandate
bounces.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Eyes of Argus", decks=242, copies="3-8") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
A +2 intercept bonus combined with a wake, a dream
come true for block-oriented decks. The intercept
only applies to directed actions though, and it cannot be used twice on the same action.
So it needs to be completed by other wake and intercept reactions.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("My Enemy's Enemy", decks=163, copies="1-3") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
Another intercept source, with the interesting bounce option
at no cost. Even though a bounce to one’s ally is a hard
bargain, with luck it can bounce a bleed back to its
original prey.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Bowl of Convergence", decks=149, copies="1") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
Very consistently played in {{ aus }} decks fielding any decent intercept module,
it is a solid permanent intercept at no cost.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Eagle's Sight", decks=103, copies="2-5") %}
{% trans trimmed
falcons_eye=card("Falcon's Eye"),
anneke=card("Anneke"),
wall=link("/strategy/archetype-categories", _("wall decks"), _anchor="wall")
%}
Only three cards in the game allow the interception of cross table actions or actions
directed to other players, this one, {{ falcons_eye }} and {{ anneke }}. This precious
ability helps {{ wall }} hurt their prey more than others, leading to an oust rather
than king-making. It's also a flexible defense against a grand-predator political
actions, and a way to control the table balance and avoid early ousts.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Enhanced Senses", decks=87, copies="2-4") %}
{% trans trimmed
my_enemy=card("My Enemy's Enemy"),
precognition=card("Precognition"),
spirits_touch=card("Spirit's Touch")
%}
An efficient intercept enhancer. Other enhancers are welcome as the same reaction card
cannot be played twice on a single action. Note that this makes an enhancer with a twist
like {{ my_enemy }} a valuable addition, compared to other enhancers with less useful
effects like {{ precognition }} or {{ spirits_touch }}.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Spirit's Touch", decks=29, copies="1-3") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
Yet another intercept enhancer, its optional maneuver at
superior {{ AUS }} can be useful in constructs using long
range combat after the block. Yet not as efficient as other
{{ aus }} reactions, it is used when additional intercept is needed.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Revelations", decks=21, copies="1-3") %}
{% trans trimmed
deflection=card("Deflection")
%}
The inferior is very useful to remove a bounce like {{ deflection }} from your
prey's hand. The superior can come in handy if you're in position to defend it.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Aura Reading", decks=21, copies="1-4") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
An excellent cycling device at superior {{ AUS }}: even with a lightweight combat module
it can help cycle just enough cards to bump the efficiency up.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Precognition", decks=21, copies="1-4") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
An additional intercept enhancer, with a decent combat bonus
at superior {{ AUS }}. As reaching high scores of intercept
requires stacking different reactions, it is used in
constructs where more diversity is needed to achieve the
desired intercept level.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Quicken Sight", decks=17, copies="2-5") %}
{% trans trimmed
enhanced_senses=card("Enhanced Senses")
%}
A great intercept enhancer, for decks where the crypt has a stable access to superior
{{ AUS }}{{ CEL }}. It's even better than the pervasive {{ enhanced_senses }}.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}
