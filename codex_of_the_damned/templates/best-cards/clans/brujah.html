        Brujah and their antitribu have some vampires with excellent abilities and
        good clan cards. Their {{pre}}{{pot}}{{cel}} disciplines combination
        give them access to excellent combat options (hindered by lack of damage prevention)
        and good political tricks. The most played archetype for the clan is the
        {{ euro_brujah }}, using Brujah princes with {{dom}}.
        The antitribu, especially with {{ armin_brenner }},
        gave birth to interesting vote constructs, too.

        Nowadays though, most Brujah {{ brujah }} decks are Anarchs builds,
        {{ brujah_resistance }} being the main archetype. Barons, with their access to the relatively new (2021)
        {{ bait_and_switch }} and {{ organized_resistance }}, are a force to be reckoned with.

{% trans trimmed
infernal_barons=link("/archetypes/infernal-barons")

{% trans trimmed
infernal_barons=link("/archetypes/infernal-barons")

{% trans trimmed
forced_march=card("Forced March")

{% trans trimmed
a_b=link("/strategy/fundamentals", _("A&B"), _anchor="AB"),
brujah_debate=card("Brujah Debate")
%}
She's on the expensive side, but her ability is an excellent {{ a_b }} enhancer.
Moreover, it makes her the perfect lead for a {{ brujah_debate }} build.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Elen Kamjian", decks=33, copies="1-2") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
She does not look like much, but her ability makes her a brutal bleeder for combat-oriented decks.

{% call layout.card_column("Adana de Sforza", decks=30, copies="1-2") %}
{% trans trimmed
lutz_politics=link("/archetypes/lutz-politics"),
girls_will_find_inner_circle=link("/archetypes/girls-will-find-inner-circle")
%}
She's rarely a star by herself, but being an Inner Circle with {{ PRE }}{{ OBF }} gets her included in many decks,
from {{ lutz_politics }} to {{ girls_will_find_inner_circle }}.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("New Carthage", decks=30, copies="1-3") %}
{% trans trimmed
%}

{% call layout.card_column("Saku Pihlajamäki", decks=23, copies="1-2") %}
{% trans trimmed
forced_march=card("Forced March")

Yet another great Brujah Baron, a useful ability and inferior {{ for }} allowing for {{ forced_march }},

{% trans trimmed
forced_march=card("Forced March")
%}
Her Justicar title combined with {{ PRE }}, {{ obf }} and a good political ability

{% trans trimmed
bait_and_switch=card("Bait and Switch"),
chun_hei=card("Chun Hei")

%}
This card is the single-handedly the core of a full-fledge archetype by itself. Combined with
{{ aline_gadeke }}'s ability and with a bit of breeding like {{ childe_of_the_revolution }},
it can be devastating.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Karen Suadela", decks=11, copies="1-3") %}
{% trans trimmed dmitra_ilyanova=card("Dmitra Ilyanova") %}
With her low cost, stealth ability and the {{ obf }}{{ pre }} disciplines combination,
