    <p>
        Ahrimanes and their unique discipline {{ spi }} provide a stronger defence
        than the usual {{ ani }} builds. Moreover, the acces to {{ pre }} allow them
        more toolboxy constructs than mono {{ ani }}, for a little more bleed.
        They offer basically two possible crypts,
        a group 2 with {{ howler }} and {{ the_siamese }},
        and a group 4 with {{ muricia }} and {{ effie_lowery }}.
    </p>
    <p>
        This clan has only one main archetype: {{ cats }}.
        Some Ahrimaines are good picks for mono {{ ani }} archetypes
        as they offer {{ ANI }} vampires for good value like
        {{ effie_lowery }} and {{ sahana }}.

{% call layout.card_column('Howler', decks=43, copies="3-5") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
Leader of the group 2 crypt, she has all clan disciplines {{ SPI }}{{ ANI }}{{ PRE }} at superior
for a cost of 8. The maneuver combined with the +1 strength bonus makes her a good warrior on her
own.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column('The Siamese', decks=42, copies="2-3") %}
{% trans trimmed howler=card("Howler") %}
{{ howler }}'s best sidekick. The bleed bonus is huge.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column('Effie Lowery', decks=41, copies="1-3") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
Superior {{ ANI }} and {{ SPI }} at a very decent cost of 5,
she is even included in pure {{ ANI }} crypts.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column('Muricia', decks=26, copies="2-4") %}
{% trans trimmed
aid_from_bats=card("Aid From Bats"),
carrion_crows=card("Carrion Crows")
%}
Leader of the group 4 crypt, she has all clan disciplines {{ SPI }}{{ ANI }}{{ PRE }} at superior
for a reasonnable cost of 7. The +1 strength bonus is always good to take: she can use a little less
{{ aid_from_bats }} for a little more {{ carrion_crows }}.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column('Nose of the Hound', decks=92, copies="1-4") %}
{% trans trimmed
bums_rush=card("Bum's Rush"),
deep_song=card("Deep Song")
%}
A nice rush action, slightly better than {{ bums_rush }}.
It is often played in {{ aus }} constructs for its base effect, as {{ ani }} provides the
arguably better {{ deep_song }} already.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Falcon's Eye", decks=64, copies="2-5") %}
{% trans trimmed
eagles_sight=card("Eagle's Sight"),
anneke=card("Anneke"),
wall_decks=link("/strategy/archetype-categories", _("wall decks"), _anchor="wall")
%}
The only card apart {{ aus }}Â {{ eagles_sight }} and {{ anneke }}
to allow cross-table blocks, it is a drastic improvement over the classical {{ ani }} intercept module.
The ability to intercept one's prey bleed or a cross-table vote is critical to {{ wall_decks }}.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column('Speak with Spirits', decks=63, copies="6-11") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
An excellent unlock and intercept reaction, the core of most Ahrimanes defensive modules.
An unlock is better than a simple wake, and the card is cheap: it costs blood only if
both unlock and intercept are needed.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column('Swiftness of the Stag', decks=62, copies="5-9") %}
{% trans trimmed
aid_from_bats=card("Aid From Bats"),
carrion_crows=card("Carrion Crows"),
resist_earths_grasp=card("Resist Earth's Grasp")
%}
A versatile tool: it is decisive in combat and works well with the {{ ani }}
classic combination of {{ aid_from_bats }} and {{ carrion_crows }}.
Moreover, the optional +1 stealth is very useful to get critical actions through.
It is a straight upgrade over the similar {{ resist_earths_grasp }}.
