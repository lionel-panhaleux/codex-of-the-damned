<h1>{{ caitiff }} Caitiff</h1>
<div class="insert tip">
    <p>
        {% trans trimmed %}
        Caitiff are rarely played on their own, but they often offer low capacity vampires
        that can complete crypts for other clans and builds.
        Now a clan, they were before considered as vampires without a clan:
        it explains why they have no library clan cards at all.

{% call layout.card_column("Anarch Convert", decks=214, copies="2-5") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
The most played Caitiff by far, he is an easy and relatively cheap way
to make vampires Anarch, and can even be used to smooth crypt rotation a bit.
