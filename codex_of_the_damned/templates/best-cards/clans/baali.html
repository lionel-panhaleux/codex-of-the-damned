    <p>
        Baali and their unique discipline {{ dai }} provide good clan cards.
        Their vampires are all <em>Infernal</em>, and 1 pool per turn is a high cost,
        but some of them, combined with the clan cards, have abilities matching this cost.
        There are multiple archetypes used by the Baali clan:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            {{ the_dark_side_of_politics }} archetype, using {{ giotto_verducci }} and
            {{ kaymakli_fragment }} to get titled vampires into play fast and cheap.
        </li>
        <li>
            The {{ girls_will_find_inner_circles }} archetype,
            using {{ cybele }} to get more Master actions.
        </li>
        <li>
            The {{ the_unnamed_arch }} archetype, a stealth & bleed construct starring,
            obviously, {{ the_unnamed }}.
        </li>
        <li>
            The {{ council_of_doom }} archetype, starring {{ huitzilopochtli }}
            along some <em>Inner Circle</em> vampires.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The titled vampires of the clan, {{ arishat }}, {{ xeper }} and {{ annazir }},
        also offer good options for political builds.
    </p>

{% call layout.card_column("Unleash Hell's Fury", decks=106, copies="1-3") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
The most played {{ dai }} card. The pool cost is steep, but it is a dreadful defence.
It can be used to deter bleeds or protect vampires against aggressive actions.
The threat of torpor without even a combat is hard to get around.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Cybele", decks=65, copies="1-7") %}
{% trans trimmed
girls_will_find_inner_circles=link("/archetypes/girls-will-find-inner-circle")
%}
The star of the Baali clan, her ability led to Master-focused decks
like {{ girls_will_find_inner_circles }}.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Veneficti", decks=57, copies="1-2") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
The best ally of the clan, Veneficti has a 2 points bleed combined with stealth,
all for the cheap cost of 1 pool. Hard to resist:
it is the kind of awesome cards one is paying the <em>Infernal</em> penalty for.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("I am Legion", decks=54, copies="1-4") %}
{% trans trimmed
telepathic_misdirection=card("Telepathic Misdirection"),
my_enemy_s_enemy=card("My Enemy's Enemy")
%}
An excellent card against {{ AUS }} bounces
{{ telepathic_misdirection }} and {{ my_enemy_s_enemy }}, it does not jam the hand
as it can be used at superior {{ OBF }}{{ DAI }} to just gain a pool for a blood
(the card text states <em>"and/or"</em>).
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Sense the Sin", decks=52, copies="2-5") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
A very versatile card, it can be used for intercept or additional bleed,
depending on the situation.
Always useful, at no cost, even with no corruption counter around.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Tend the Flock", decks=45, copies="3-8") %}
{% trans trimmed
cybele=card("Cybele"),
grooming_the_protege=card("Grooming the Protege")
%}
An excellent bloat device. Played in many Baali decks,
it also plays well with {{ cybele }} ability.
This card helps to make up for the <em>Infernal</em> penalty and is straightly better than
{{ grooming_the_protege }}.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("The Horde", decks=39, copies="2-7") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
An excellent sidekick - its ability can be used to boost older vampires bleed easily,
even from torpor.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Psychomachia", decks=37, copies="1-3") %}
{% trans trimmed
cybele=card("Cybele"),
the_unnamed=card("The unnamed")
%}
A decent block denial, although limited to younger vampires and allies,
it still applies to a lot of minions when
one plays {{ cybele }} or {{ the_unnamed }}.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Contagion", decks=37, copies="1") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
A decent pool damage provider, although often played as a single copy in Baali decks.
It is a way to bring the pool cost around the table closer to the one one has to pay
to unlock Infernal vampires, and is more useful in slow-paced decks.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Arishat", decks=36, copies="1-3") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
An excellent vampire, with an excellent ability for politics, defensively or offensively.
Depending on the opposition, she can offer a swing from 1 to 4 votes reliably.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("The Unnamed", decks=34, copies="4-5") %}
{% trans trimmed
own_archetype=link("/archetypes/the-unnamed", _("own archetype"))
%}
Star of his {{ own_archetype }}, his ability makes for a very comfortable bloat.
His access to such a powerful disciplines combination allows him to use a broad range of cards.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Xeper, Sultan of Lepers", decks=34, copies="1-3") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
An excellent vampire, with a very annoying ability against ally constructs and a decent one
for vote constructs. His inferior {{ dai }} is almost not an issue.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Annazir", decks=32, copies="1-3") %}
{% trans trimmed
bowl_of_convergence=card("Bowl of Convergence")
%}
Another excellent vampire, all clan disciplines at superior, votes and enhanced bleed,
plus a nice ability that can become useful to get rid of a gun or a
{{ bowl_of_convergence }}.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Infernal Servitor", decks=20, copies="2-4") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
An excellent ally: although he does not stay in play,
his bleed power is huge and can make for a very nice lunge.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Flames of the Netherworld", decks=16, copies="1-4") %}
{% trans trimmed
walk_of_flame=card("Walk of Flame"),
burst_of_sunlight=card("Burst of Sunlight")
%}
A very good combat strike. More often seen in fact in TremereÂ {{ tremere }}
decks using {{ tha }}, as it is a good alternative to other aggravated damage source
{{ tha }} provides like {{ walk_of_flame }} or {{ burst_of_sunlight }}.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Condemnation: Mute", decks=16, copies="1-6") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
An excellent card for politics, both defensively and offensively.
Even Baali decks with no take on the politics game can play it
just to hinder a politic opponent.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}
