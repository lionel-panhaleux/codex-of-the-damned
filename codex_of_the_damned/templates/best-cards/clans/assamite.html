    <p>
        Assamite and their unique {{qui}} discipline provide some good clan cards
        and multiple strategies usually revolving around {{obf}} for stealth.
        This clan has four main archetypes:
    <ul>
        <li>
            {{ amaravati_politics }}, a political archetype with {{ amaravati }}.
        </li>
        <li>
            The {{ death_star }}, an anarch politics archetype.
        </li>
        <li>
            The {{ black_hand }} swarm archetype, from which
            the Asssamite variation is the most common.
        </li>
        <li>
            {{ dimitri_s_big_band }}, a toolbox archetype using {{ dmitri_borodin }}
            and the {{AUS}}{{CEL}}{{QUI}} disciplines combination.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

{% call layout.card_column("Haqim's Law: Leadership", decks=28, copies="3-9") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
A good action card for bloating. Assamite decks are rare,
and most of them built around breeding.
This action makes good use of the many low capacity Assamites
one can have in this context.
Even just a few copies already make for a good bloat.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Khabar: Glory", decks=28, copies="1-3") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
A bleed enhancer with a 4 pool bloat bonus if timely played.
Most Assamite decks include one or two of these for the lunge.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Yoruba Shrine", decks=26, copies="1") %}
{% trans trimmed
    banishment = card("Banishment")
%}
An excellent defence against rush actions, but also against {{ banishment }},
an all-too-common option in big capacity vote decks.
The cost of 1 pool is fairly low.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Alamut", decks=24, copies="1-4") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
An excellent vote enhancer at a fair cost for any archetype.
It is played for additional votes in political decks,
but also as a defensive tool against political actions in other decks.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("The Black Throne", decks=18, copies="1-2") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
Another cheap vote enhancer, 2 votes for 1 pool is quite worth it.
The contract part of the card is seldom used.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Web of Knives Recruit", decks=18, copies="3-6") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
An interesting breeding card: it is a bit slow as the new vampire
only comes out after 3 turns but, on the other hand,
the neonate has the three clan disciplines {{qui}}{{obf}}{{cel}} at basic level
and three blood, all for the low cost of 1 pool.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Amaravati", decks=17, copies="2-4") %}
{% trans trimmed
    amaravati_politics=link("/archetypes/amaravati-politics"),
    web_of_knives_recruit=card("Web of Knives Recruit"),
    alamut=card("Alamut"),
    the_black_throne=card("The Black Throne"),
    deflection=card("Deflection")
%}
The star of the {{ amaravati_politics }} archetype,
combined with {{ web_of_knives_recruit }}, {{ alamut }} and {{ the_black_throne }},
he builds up a strong vote lock.
Moreover, his superior {{DOM}} gets him bounce reactions like {{ deflection }}.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Djuhah, The Bronze Bow", decks=11, copies="2-3") %}
{% trans trimmed
    black_hand=link("/archetypes/black-hand")
%}
One of the best Seraph of the game, Djuhah also has good company in his clan
as 5 Black Hand Assamite are available in groups 4 and 5.
This led to the Assamite variation of the {{ black_hand }} swarm archetype.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Market Square", decks=11, copies="1") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
An excellent permanent intercept at low cost.
Used in all Assamite decks when blocking is an option.
Swarm builds have no use for it though.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Loss", decks=26, copies="3-10") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
A strong bleed action, played in most Assamite decks.
The inferior {{qui}} option can also come in handy.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Black Sunrise", decks=21, copies="2-8") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
An excellent reaction, which actually unlocks - not just wake - the vampire.
This can be better as the vampire stays unlocked if he fails to block the action,
but being forced to block can be tricky if the goal is to bounce a bleed.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Taste of Death", decks=13, copies="1-4") %}
{% trans trimmed
    selective_silence=card("Selective Silence")
%}
Worth mentioning as it is the most played {{qui}} combat card,
it is still hard to include as excellent range management is necessary to make it work.
{{ selective_silence }} is a good option,
but two cards and two blood is a high price to pay for it.
