        The Followers of Set and their unique {{ ser }} discipline
        are devious experts of sin and stealth.
        They have given birth to ecclectic decks around politics and mummies
        but their most successful archetype is the {{ bima_dominate }},
        using the {{ bima }} ally with {{ dom }}.

{% call layout.card_column("Opium Den", decks=57, copies="1") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
A nice permanent stealth enhancer at a low cost, a must have for the Followers.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Enticement", decks=41, copies="1-4") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
Pool damage without a bleed: this makes it impervious
to bounces and other anti-bleed tools.
2 or 3 copies of the card to avoid a bounce on a lunge is common.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Temptation", decks=37, copies="2-9") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
A versatile, if tricky, card. It can even be put on one's own vampires
to get two actions in a single turn from time to time.
On an opponent's vampire, he will think twice before getting too low on blood.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Form of Corruption", decks=36, copies="1-2") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
This can be a serious blow to a prey if it put into play early enough.
Only a few cards can change the control of a vampire permanently.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Truth of a Thousand Lies", decks=32, copies="2-6") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
Although costly, this is a very versatile tool â€” enhancing bleed at {{ ser }}
or getting another action at {{ SER }} are both excellent.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Nakhthorheb", decks=30, copies="1-4") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
A star among the Followers, his ability to get two actions in a single turn
is a serious asset.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Set's Curse", decks=24, copies="1-3") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
An excellent action against allies and breed constructs,
it can get rid of a minion in a single blow, and give a minion back.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Renenet", decks=22, copies="1-2") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
A powerful disciplines combination for just 5 pool.
She can even find her place in a mono {{ pre }} deck.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}
