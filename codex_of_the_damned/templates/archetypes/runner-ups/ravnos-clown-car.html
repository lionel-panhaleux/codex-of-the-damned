<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>breed & boon</em> deck using the Ravnos clan.
    Low capacity Ravnos use {{ mozambique_allure }} to become Laibon,
    then multiply with {{ the_embrace }} and {{ bamba }}, paying them with
    {{ ravnos_carnival }} and using {{ the_eldest_are_kholo }} with
    {{ consanguineous_boon }} to bloat.
</p>
<p>
    When enough minions are out, the {{ week_of_nightmares }} gets into play
    and all these Ravnos bleed their prey to death, one after the other.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ the_uncoiling }} is a tactical counter against
    {{ scourge_of_the_enochians }}, as this event
    is often included in slow decks as a counter against breed constructs like this one.
</p>
<p>
    {{ gird_minions }} help get the minions back in shape
    if the bloat works well enough, in order to produce yet another wave of neonates.
</p>
<p>
    {{ life_boon }} is also a way to control the table a bit if
    the bloat goes well enough. The deck usually does not put that much pressure on its prey until
    {{ week_of_nightmares }} hits the table, so this can compensate a bit.
</p>
<p>
    The deck does not try to block its predator, counting on its bloat to compensate.
    {{ aranthebes_the_immortal }} is included
    only as a counter to contest it if anyone gets to put it into play,
    as it is too damaging to this deck.
</p>
<p>
    {{ autarkis_persecution }} is included as a hail mary
    if one gets stuck with low pool and someone uses
    {{ delaying_tactics }} against {{ consanguineous_boon }}.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    There are not many variants for this archetype.
    {{ miguel_pascual_s_deck }} in 2008 has experimented with {{ rom_gypsy }}
    to provide an additional bit of stealth and defence.
    The card has been banned in 2020, but its replacement {{ city_star_taxi }} can
    be used instead.
