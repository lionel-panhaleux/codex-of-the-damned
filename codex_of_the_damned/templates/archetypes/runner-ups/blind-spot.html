<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>powerbleed</em> deck that relies on {{ lucian_the_perfect }} for huge bleeds,
    combined with a lot of block denial and, specifically, some {{ blind_spot }}.
</p>
<p>
    The idea is very simple: get {{ lucian }} out, then bleed for 6 to 12,
    disregarding the possibility of {{ archon_investigation }}.
    To get the bleed through, there is a bit of stealth but the main strategy
    is to combine multiple block denials like {{ blind_spot }}, {{ seduction }}
    and {{ elder_impersonation }} to prevent all the minions of the prey from blocking.
</p>
<p>
    The deck is brutal and can obliterate a table in just 10 turns if it's lucky.
    {{ blind_spot }} is particularily vicious because it also prevents reactions, hence
    {{ bounces }}. That makes it harder for the prey to defend against the high bleeds.
    Of course, for the card to work at all, one needs the highest capacity on the table.
    Because it relies on block denials, the deck can go through highly defensive
    toolboxes and walls as if they weren't even there.
</p>
<p>
    The Master module provides crypt acceleration with {{ zillahs_valley }},
    {{ information_highway }} and {{ dreams_of_the_sphinx }}.
</p>
<p>
    The deck relies on {{ obedience }}, {{ charismatic_aura }} and {{ majesty }} to avoid combat,
    and sports some {{ AUS }} sidekicks for support.
    They can bounce with {{ telepathic_misdirection }}, try to remove defensive tools from the prey's hand using
    {{ revelations }}, or even call some votes that can be negotiated with the rest of the table.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ lucian }} bleeds hard, and his ability makes him a decent blocker, especially combined with {{ majesty }}.
    The deck has no intercept, but his ability to block swarms that do not use stealth is actually pretty high.
</p>
<p>
    {{ enkil_cog }} is, of course, desirable. Especially because one can use it to bleed
    during the prey's turn, which will completely negate the possibility of an
    {{ archon_investigation }}: since it's an out-of-turn Master, it cannot be played
    by the prey during their own turn.
</p>
<p>
    The deck fields an awful lot of cards in a single copy that fit specific situations:
    it is all about crafting the perfect lunge to oust the prey in a single swift move.
    So, patience is required in building up the perfect table situation {{ lucian }} needs to shine.
    {{ revelations }} can be used to remove a bounce or a potential {{ archon_investigation }},
    {{ hide_the_mind }} can counter an Auspex {{ AUS }} bounce and {{ approximation_of_loyalty }}, any bounce,
    if the reacting vampire is young enough.
</p>
<p>
    This version include a few votes that might be negotiated even on a table with multiple titled vampires.
    But the deck also include a surprising number of incidental vote increases, between {{ ancestor_spirit }},
    {{ iron_glare }}, {{ perfect_paragon }} and {{ kduvas_mask }}, not mentioning {{ legendary_vampire }}.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    The more brutal <strong>Inner Circle</strong> variant is much more forward-focused, using more {{ blind_spot }},
    {{ seduction }} and {{ conditioning }}, for a more streamlined and direct aggression.
    See {{ desso_alastors_deck }} for an example.
