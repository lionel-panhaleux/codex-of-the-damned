<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is an Akunanse <em>toolbox</em> deck, using {{ ABO }}{{ ANI }}{{ FOR }}.
    Depending on the build, it can be a pure wall or use <em>Magaji</em> and include some political cards.
    The idea is to use the classical big capacity {{ ani }} Intercept combination
    ({{ raven_spy }}, {{ cats_guidance }}, {{ sense_the_savage_way }})
    combined with the excellent {{ abo }} wake/intercept card: {{ predators_communion }}.
</p>
<p>
    The combat module is short-ranged, using
    {{ invoking_the_beast }} in combination with {{ carrion_crows }}.
    {{ for }} provides a welcome damage prevention for more sturdiness.
</p>
<p>
    This is a slow play, slowing down the prey and predator and bloating a bit with Master cards,
    all the while bleeding when possible with {{ deep_song }} and {{ predators_mastery }}.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    As Akunanse are Laibon, they have access to some niche cards:
    {{ powerbase_luanda }} is invaluable for increasing the rush power,
    {{ well_marked }} helps with damage mitigation and {{ shaman }}
    is slightly better than a {{ raven_spy }}.
</p>
<p>
    {{ for }} provides the excellent {{ freak_drive }}, improving {{ a_b }} quite a bit.
</p>
<p>
    Combining the big capacity vampires access to {{ sense_the_savage_way }} with
    {{ predators_communion }} and {{ cats_guidance }} means every reaction card is a wake
    of some kind. This makes for a strong wall.
</p>
<p>
    Both {{ fakir_al_sidi }} and {{ matata }} have a +1 strength bonus and a press,
    a nice combination for the short-ranged combat module.
</p>
<h2>Creator Insights</h2>
<p>
    <em>Dávid Farkas</em> was kind enough to provide the following insights:
</p>
<p>
    The biggest strenght of the deck are <strong>permanency</strong> and <strong>versatility</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    By <strong>permanency</strong>, I mean that even with 100% hand jam, the deck can function just fine.
    {{ fakir_al_sidi }} and {{ matata }} can both fight a combat and deal a total of
    4 damage without a single card. Permanent intercept is also awesome.
</p>
<p>
    As for <strong>versatility</strong>, every single intercept reaction is also a form of wake.
    The fact that {{ deep_song }} is both a rush and a bleed means
    that the deck has an usual lunge potential, as he can bleed for 9 with 3 minions.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    Minor variations exist for the combat module, as it can also contain
    {{ devil_channel_back }} and/or {{ devil_channel_hands }}.
</p>
<p>
    An original module played by {{ michael_bartsch }} in 2015 uses
    {{ pack_alpha }} alongside {{ duma_rafiki }} and {{ elephant_guardian }}.
</p>
<p>
    Many versions of this deck also include the {{ abombwe }}
    discipline card: as it's a <em>Trifle</em>, hence a cheap card to improve
    {{ fakir_al_sidi }} or {{ sanjo }}.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Magaji</strong> variant disregards
    {{ fakir_al_sidi }} and {{ matata }} to use the <em>Magaji</em> {{ umdava }} and
    {{ nkule_galadima }} instead.
    Together with {{ uchenna }}, they all can play {{ no_secrets_from_the_magaji }},
    a powerful addition to the intercept module. Furthermore, this allows the inclusion of some political actions
    for a bit more versatility. To free some slots up, the bleed power of the deck is toned down.
    {{ noel_gimenez_infantes_deck }} from the 2012 Spanish ECQ is a good example of this variant.
