<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>wall</em> deck using low capacity vampires with the {{ AUS }}
    discipline. {{ anarch_convert }} is used to make the vampires <em>Anarch</em>
    as soon as they come into play.
</p>
<p>
    Pool damage is done by putting {{ anarch_revolt }}, {{ smiling_jack_the_anarch }}
    and {{ constant_revolution }} into play and defending them,
    and using {{ monkey_wrench }} for the lunge.
</p>
<p>
    The deck has very high intercept and wake capabilities. It uses the
    {{ concealed_weapon }} + {{ sniper_rifle }} combination for combat, and
    {{ forced_awakening }} and {{ my_enemy_s_enemy }} to bounce bleeds and increase
    pool damage to the prey.
</p>
<p>
    It has low bloat capacities, with only {{ tribute_to_the_master }} and
    {{ powerbase_montreal }} at hand.
</p>
<p>
    The deck is slow and steady, grinding the opponents until it is in position
    to oust the whole table one prey after the other.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ ashur_tablets }} are used only once for a bloat and
    a bit of recursion. If another deck on the table uses them though, one can try
    to negociate to use them alternatively on both side (a {{ classic_deal }}),
    thus blocking the opponent as long as he respects the deal.
</p>
<p>
    {{ eagle_s_sight }} can be used to intercept any action,
    including the prey's bleed. It can be used to specifically target any
    <em>Anarch</em> vampire the prey could have to make sure the {{ anarch_revolt }} are
    fully operationnal.
</p>
<p>
    {{ the_parthenon }} allows two Master cards per turn,
    potentially stacking {{ anarch_revolt }} more quickly.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    There are many small variations of this archetype.
    {{ magnum }} and {{ ivory_bow }} are often used.
    The given example avoids any action that could be blocked,
    except for a lunge bleed using {{ monkey_wrench }} and two allies.
    However, {{ aranthebes_the_immortal }}, {{ mr_winthrop }},
    {{ muddled_vampire_hunter }} and {{ bowl_of_convergence }} are often used in other
    decklists following this archetype. {{ blood_turnip }} might deserve consideration.
</p>
<p>
    Non-anarch variants have been played, like {{ christian_chenard_s_deck }} from 2008.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Madness</strong> variant focuses on Malkavian {{ malkavian }}
    in the crypt and uses {{ madness_network }}. {{ pascal_bertrand_s_deck }} from 2009
    is a good example. This let the vampires equip, recruit and bleed at the end of the
    predator minion phase.
