<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a multiclan {{ toolbox }} relying on Anarch Barons and the great Protean {{ pro }} discipline.
</p>
<p>
    Barons allow for great defense with {{ bait_and_switch }} and {{ organized_resistance }},
    while Protean {{ pro }} is maybe the most versatile discipline in the game, with stealth like {{ earth_control }}
    and combat both defensive with {{ earth_meld }} and offensive with {{ donnybrook }}.
</p>
<p>
    Putting both together with a few Anarch cards like {{ club_illusion }} and {{ monkey_wrench }} to improve bleed,
    or {{ the_anarch_free_press }}Â and {{ protection_racket }} to improve intercept, one gets a versatile toolbox.
</p>
<p>
    Since the deck recoups pool with {{ villein }}, to influence more barons, and creates additional minions with
    {{ childe_of_the_revolution }}, who also get Protean {{ pro }} thanks to the master discipline {{ protean_card }}.
    As the game progresses, the swarms only grows, bleeding and defending
</p>
<p>
    The prey can be ousted with pure bleed, but there are also a couple of alternative options just in case,
    with {{ constant_revolution }}, {{ eat_the_rich }} and {{ revolutionary_council }}.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ dark_influences }} is a bit expensive, but can have even more impact than an {{ direct_intervention }}:
    preventing a certain card for a whole turn can be game changing.
</p>
<p>
    {{ the_erciyes_fragments }} is a very good inclusion here: given the spread of disciplines among the barons,
    they can play almost any card.
</p>
<p>
    Card flow can be problematic, so {{ heart_of_nizchetus }} and {{ powerbase_los_angeles }} are included
    to help with that.
</p>
<p>
    Because of the {{ childe_of_the_revolution }} swarm and all the {{ earth_meld }}, the deck can function a bit like
    a "tap and bleed", aiming at exhausting the prey's wake and unlock defenses.
    That makes {{ anarch_troublemaker }} a nice inclusion for a lunge.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    This deck is inspired by {{ simo_tiippana_s_deck }} with some adaptations.
    {{ the_uncoiling }} should probably have stayed in the list, for example.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Death Star</strong> variant played by {{ tommi_hakomaa }} uses {{ ashur_tablets }},
    includes some {{ form_of_mist }} for more stealth, and focuses more on {{ revolutionary_council }} as a
    lunge device.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Rush</strong> variant forgoes the {{ childe_of_the_revolution }} swarm to instead include
    {{ bums_rush }} and {{ open_war }} as well as a more aggressive combat module, for a very different toolbox,
    see {{ diego_rodrigues_deck }} for example, an idea credited to <em>Bram van Stappen</em>.
</p>
<p>
    This is somehow close to the {{ gangrel_thing }} archetype, with less intercept capabilities but more votes.
