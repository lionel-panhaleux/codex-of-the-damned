<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>vote</em> deck using {{ arishat }} as a star, and Ministry Barons for support.
</p>
<p>
    The plan is to land high damage votes like {{ reckless_agitation }}, {{ kine_resources_contested }} and
    {{ eat_the_rich }}, using {{ obf }} for stealth and {{ pre }} for votes. {{ arishat }} controls
    the opponents' votes, both with her ability and {{ condemnation_mute }}, disabling
    any problematic voters on the table.
</p>
<p>
    The defense module is small but effective, using {{ majesty }} to avoid combat and {{ organized_resistance }} and
    {{ bait_and_switch }} for bleed defense. {{ villein }} is used to recoup pool from the vampires and, coupled with
    {{ voter_captivation }} can allow for heavy bloating and more minions rather steadily.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    The decks uses {{ forgotten_labyrinth }} as the main stealth modifier: it costs blood but easily
    gets above a {{ second_tradition_domain }}, and votes are undirected, so some widespread intercept reactions
    like {{ eyes_of_argus }} or {{ deep_ecology }} will not help. 3 stealth undirected is hard to block.
</p>
<p>
    {{ garibaldi_meucci_museum }} is key, as it can fetch back votes ({{ reckless_agitation }},
    {{ eat_the_rich }}) or bounces ({{ bait_and_switch }}) depending. Moreover, it can protect
    vampires from some dangerous combats.
</p>
<p>
    The number of {{ information_highway }} is unusally high, because it can help getting more titled vampires out more
    quickly, and get the {{ villein }} / {{ voter_captivation }} going faster.
</p>
<p>
    The deck does not shy away from bleeding when there's an opening. {{ monkey_wrench }} can maximise
    these opportunities, and just getting the edge even with a bleed for one might be all what's
    needed to {{ eat_the_rich }}.
</p>
<p>
    {{ unleash_hells_fury }} is a key defensive device. It can really slow down some predators.
    Swarm decks will not be too hindered by it though, but {{ anarchist_uprising }} and {{ ancilla_empowerment }}
    can take care of those.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    {{ xeper }} is specific to this version: he's often absent because of his
    cost, and replaced by some {{ entrancement }}. On the reaction side, {{ on_the_qui_vive }} is
    often preferred to {{ organized_resistance }}, since it does not force a block. Additional Infernal tools can show
    up, like {{ veneficti }} or {{ kaymakli_fragment }}.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Dominica</strong> variant includes {{ dominica }} with {{ saulot_s_guiding_wisdom }}
    and depends less on {{ arishat }}. It lowers contest issues and provides rush defense,
    but lets go of {{ unleash_hells_fury }} and {{ condemnation_mute }}.
    See {{ tomàs_lópez_jiménez_deck }} for reference.
</p>
<p>
    The idea is close to the {{ infernal_princes }} archetype. Strong votes under {{ obf }},
    heavy use of {{ forgotten_labyrinth }}, and a bit of {{ pre }} for vote pushing and {{ voter_captivation }}:
    they share more than half their cards.
    But the defense strategies differ: going {{ condemnation_mute }} and {{ bait_and_switch }} or going
    {{ parity_shift }} with more minions are different game plans.
