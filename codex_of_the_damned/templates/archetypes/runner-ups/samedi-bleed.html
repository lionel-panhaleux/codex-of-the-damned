<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>stealth & bleed</em> deck from the Samedi {{ samedi }} clan.
    It's worth mentioning since it won two tournaments in 2014, although it was in the
    hands of the same Methuselah, <em>David Litwin</em>.
</p>
<p>
    The point of the deck is to use {{ THN }} and {{ OBF }} for stealth in order to get
    bleeds through, then use a lot of {{ freak_drive }} to bloat and get more vampires
    out. If it stays unchecked, the deck bloats a lot and get enough Samedi {{ samedi }}
    in play that there aggregated bleed power can oust the whole table.
</p>
<p>
    The deck uses permanent bleed enhancers: a handful of {{ camera_phone }},
    the base bonus of some of the vampires like {{ the_baron }} and
    {{ reg_driscoll }} and, interestingly, {{ legendary_vampire }}.
    Stealth is high, making full use of {{ under_my_skin }} to get a two-in-one kind of
    deal that can make even high intercept decks think twice before attempting a block.
</p>
<p>
    The specificity of this deck is definitely in the number of {{ freak_drive }}.
    Associated with the bloat and crypt acceleration actions
    {{ dark_mirror_of_the_mind }}, {{ little_mountain_cemetery }} and {{ off_kilter }},
    it quickly becomes a nice blood-generating machine. The whole deck is built around
    this idea, with {{ coroners_contact }} bringing more vampires in the crypt to
    benefit from {{ little_mountain_cemetery }}, {{ houngan }} and {{ perfectionist }}
    bringing a bit more blood on the table, and {{ powerbase_zurich }} for yet
    another source of blood.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    The timing question on the influence phase is important: the plan is
    to keep vampires uncontrolled as much as possible to benefit more from
    the numerous {{ little_mountain_cemetery }}. As soon as the vampires get out,
    they can be rushed and blocked and {{ little_mountain_cemetery }} loses a lot its
    interest. But while they're still uncontrolled, the deck is pretty low profile
    and non dangerous: a good thing on a table. Some cards in the deck are included
    to take advantage of this odd timing question of not wanting to get the vampires
    out too soon. For example, {{ legendary_vampire }} is very strong: since the deck
    already plans to keep its vampires uncontrolled for a bit, it can wait to get it
    in hand before influencing a vampire out. {{ kaymakli_nightmares }} also follows
    the same logic: here it is not used to slow down the rest of the table in the
    beginning, it is a bloating tool that allows the deck to take back all of the blood
    that has been stacked in the uncontrolled region.
</p>
<p>
    Obviously having more transfers is a good thing - enough blood gets stacked in
    the uncontrolled zone that it should be taken back in pool to resist the predator.
    {{ information_highway }} is useful in the long run here, to the point that it
    might still be useful in the middle and end game.
</p>
<p>
    Bleeding with no bounce available for defense, the deck easily benefits from
    {{ narrow_minds }} and the {{ archon_investigation }} can stop a greedy predator
    right in his tracks.
</p>

    <h3>Rule Change</h3>
    The deck was built and played before the 2018 change in influencing rule
    {{ rtr_20180303 }}. Nowadays, one can refrain from putting a vampire in play when
    the blood matches their capacity. This might change quite a few things in this deck,
    in a good way. It makes it easier to benefit from {{ little_mountain_cemetery }}.
