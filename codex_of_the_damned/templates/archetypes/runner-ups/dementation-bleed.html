<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>stealth & bleed</em> deck using the {{ dem }}{{ obf }} disciplines.
    The idea is to bring maximum pool damage to the prey as fast as possible.
</p>
<p>
    Stealth is high, with many Obfuscate {{ OBF }} and a few Dementation {{ dem }} modifiers.
    Some vampires in the crypt have a native +1 bleed ability, and the deck includes
    a lot of {{ eyes_of_chaos }} to bring each bleed to a potential 4 or 5.
</p>
<p>
    Two thirds of the vampires have {{ AUS }}, so {{ telepathic_misdirection }} is
    used against bleeds, in large numbers.
</p>
<p>
    {{ kindred_spirits }} provides some bloat by itself and should let the deck get three or even four vampires out.
</p>
<p>
    When it comes down to combat, the deck relies on {{ coma }} to deter the opponents.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ revelations }} and {{ spying_mission }} are two options to avoid {{ bounces }} from the prey.
</p>
<p>
    A few master cards help with cycling, to avoid jamming on stealth: {{ dreams_of_the_sphinx }},
    {{ the_barrens }} and {{ fragment_of_the_book_of_nod }}.
    might be pointless if the prey is not using {{ dom }}
    bounces, but it can also be used defensivly to prevent a {{ dom }} or {{ pre }}
    bleed action.
</p>
<p>
    {{ coma }} is somewhat unusual in such numbers: {{ no_trace }} is often preferred.
    However, it is more efficient against close range combat decks relying on combat continuance
    like {{ psyche }} or {{ relentless_reaper }}. It is no better against {{ immortal_grapple }}, though.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    Depending on what's expected, a few other cards could find their place in the deck.
    {{ the_call }} is a common inclusion, while
    {{ touch_of_clarity }} and {{ hide_the_mind }} can be included against the widespread {{ AUS }} and {{ dom }}
    {{ bounces }}, but they do nothing for {{ bait_and_switch }}.
    More {{ wash }} and {{ sudden_reversal }} are a possibility, to counter permanent
    intercept locations like {{ krcg_news_radio }} and bloat devices like {{ villein }}.
    Finally, a couple of {{ restructure }} can be added against allies.
</p>
<p>
    {{ louhi }} can give birth to interesting variations thanks to his ability,
    like in {{ pedros_deck }} from 2015: {{ villein }} are out of question since
    he'll need his blood for his ability, but {{ the_call }} can be used to compensate.
    The result is slower, but {{ louhi }}'s ability can be devastating against some decks.
</p>
<p>
    The deck can be built with Dementation {{ DEM }} only, and lower capacity vampires,
    as in {{ alessandro_donati_s_deck }} from the 2022 Italian NC. This is faster,
    but also more fragile as the stealth gets lower and the vampires have no good
    solution against combat.
