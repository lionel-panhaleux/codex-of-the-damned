    "comments": "Description: This deck is heavily inspired by Simo Tiippana's \"Garou Rim: Foreshadowing Destruction\" deck (TWD 11456) but I tweaked it a lot, removing the \"bad\" 8-cap barons to include smaller PRO vampire and reworking the master module.\nI doubled all the key cards (so that the only copy doesn't end up in the bottom of the deck): Carfax (blood is crucial), Garibaldi (recursion is strong), and Club Illusion (because we need it to oust!). I played the deck at the EC, and noticed that the cardflow could be problematic, so I added two Heart of Nizchetus and a Powerbase: Los Angeles.\nI didn't put The Uncoiling, but Scourge is really a pain in the a**, so it could be included somehow.\nThe Dark Influences completely screwed my predator during the final (by preventing him from getting a Renegade Garou with his 2-cap before any baron was out to block) and other predators during other rounds playing Immortal Grapple or whatever.\nThe Erciyes Fragments was a last-minute addition, allowing me to oust to preys with their own bleed cards, but also to retrieve Carrion Crows during the final to fight against the Renegade Garous. The Discipline spread is so wide that you can almost play any card.\n",
