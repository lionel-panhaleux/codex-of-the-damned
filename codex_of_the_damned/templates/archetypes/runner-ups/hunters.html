<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>toolbox</em> Imbued deck. They are mortal allies and follow {{ specific_rules }}.
    They use <em>Conviction</em> and <em>Power</em> cards.
</p>
<p>
    The idea of the deck is to get some Imbued out, {{ jennie }} first if she's drawn,
    then equip them with weapons and armors to be able to hunt and take down vampires around the table.
    {{ angel_of_berlin }} and {{ nra_pac }} are used to help equip them quickly.
</p>
<p>
    As the game progresses, <em>Powers</em> make the Imbued more powerful.
    {{ vigilance }} is the most important, as it enhances {{ a_b }} a lot.
    {{ champion }} and {{ discern }} help bump up the defence.
</p>
<p>
    {{ talbot_s_chainsaw }} is the key here, as its rush ability combined with its damage is very potent,
    and its disadvantage can be mitigated by {{ rejuvenate }} and {{ jennie }}'s ability.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, {{ travis }}, {{ the_church_of_vindicated_faith }} and
    {{ inspire }} are used to bloat and accelerate the crypt.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ react_with_conviction }} is always the first <em>Conviction</em> an Imbued
    should fetch when he comes into play, as it protects them against
    anti-ally actions like {{ entrancement }}.
</p>
<p>
    {{ smiling_jack_the_anarch }}, {{ tension_in_the_ranks }} and {{ dragonbound }}
    can improve pool damage a bit, but most damage come from bleed using
    {{ strike_with_conviction }}. If the bleed action of
    {{ strike_with_conviction }} is blocked, the <em>Conviction</em> is not lost,
    as its burn effect is the <em>cost</em> of the action,
    only payed if it is successul.
    It can then be used as a strike during the follow-up combat.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    Decks in this archetype use different weapons and combat modules: the use of
    {{ talbot_s_chainsaw }} is rare. {{ target_vitals }} is a common inclusion,
    and {{ sniper_rifle }} is a more common weapon, as in {{ cory_busch_kendall_s_deck }} from 2010.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Paralyze</strong> variant uses the {{ concealed_weapon }} & {{ flash_grenade }}
    combination and has been played by {{ john_newquist_in_a_2008_nac_qualifier }}.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Apocalypse</strong> variant include more <em>Gehenna</em> events
    to cripple vampires around the table, as Imbued stay immuned to their effects.
    {{ sergio_gracia_s_deck }} from 2010 is a good example.
