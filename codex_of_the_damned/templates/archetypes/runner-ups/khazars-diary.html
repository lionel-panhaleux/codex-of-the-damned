<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is an <em>swarm</em> deck using multiple unique allies. The idea is to put
    {{ khazar_s_diary }} into play, breed a bit with {{ the_embrace }},
    defend by putting some allies into play and wait until {{ khazar_s_diary }} triggers.
    At this point, the dead allies come back into play as wraith to stealth & bleed the
    successive preys out of the game.
</p>
<p>
    The high recursion using {{ sudario_refraction }}
    is a strong point of the deck, allowing it to adapt its defence to the table context.
    It is very passive in the game beginning and uses
    {{ deflection }} and {{ delaying_tactics }} to defend a much as possible.
</p>
<p>
    The deck is focused on bringing as many minions into play as possible, and relies a lot on the allies
    and their capacities. As such, it does have only limited combat, bleed or stealth modules.
    However, it hopes to quickly bring into play good rush or intercept allies like
    {{ carlton_van_wyk }}, {{ ossian }} and {{ shambling_hordes }} to improve its defence.
</p>
<p>
    {{ shambling_hordes }} is a particularily strong rush minion: it is not <em>Unique</em>
    (and as such does not add a counter to {{ khazar_s_diary }} when it burns),
    but it is strong enough a defence to be included nonetheless.
    And given the rest of the deck mechanics and the numerous {{ liquidation }},
    it will easily find an ally in the ash heap.
</p>
<p>
    {{ the_unmasking }} and {{ fbi_special_affairs_division }} help
    making all these allies stronger defenders when they come into play.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ jake_washington }} is an excellent device in this deck
    as burning him in any way will add one counter on {{ khazar_s_diary }} easily.
</p>
<p>
    This variant uses {{ the_parthenon }} to get to play more masters and improve its bloat with
    {{ liquidation }} and {{ vessel }}.
    Destroying some {{ blood_doll }} using {{ vessel }} has a bit of value in this deck, as
    {{ gregory_winter }} and {{ young_bloods }} can stack over the rush allies
    to bring a strong blood attrition to the table.
</p>
<p>
    {{ repo_man }} is a cheap unique ally, and, with his 1 life, dies pretty quickly if he blocks.
    Which is the point when one uses {{ khazar_s_diary }}.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    Minor variations exist, for example {{ inaki_puigdollers_s_deck }} from 2009 uses
    {{ change_of_target }} to help protect the minions — even the allies — from unforseen blocks.
    He also included some {{ tupdogs }} in the crypt:
    they can not undertake directed actions but they avoid repeating minions in the crypt,
    they can still block, recruit an ally like the {{ repo_man }},
    and provide one more minion to bring back as a wraith once {{ khazar_s_diary }} kicks in.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Anarch</strong> variant, as seen in {{ roberto_venturi_s_deck }} from 2011,
    uses {{ anarch_convert }} for a better rotation and to make all these Giovanni Anarch,
    so they can use {{ cry_wolf }}, an exceptionnaly well suited ally for the {{ khazar_s_diary }}:
    it is unique and burns automatically. It provides the same kind of rush defence
    {{ ossian }} and {{ shambling_hordes }} do in the example deck.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Faeries</strong> variant was played in {{ enrico_de_stefano_s_deck }} from 2018.
    It uses a dozen {{ draeven_softfoot }} and their burn option to quickly bring more allies into the ash heap,
    making it easier to get {{ shambling_hordes }} into play.
    It also uses more copies of {{ the_embrace }} and {{ khazar_s_diary }}
    as the idea is to trigger the Diary sooner, and bring all these
    {{ draeven_softfoot }} back as wraith with the new born vampires,
    for a faster, more aggressive version of the archetype.
