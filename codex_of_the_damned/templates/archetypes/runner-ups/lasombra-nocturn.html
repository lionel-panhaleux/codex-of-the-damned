<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>stealth & bleed</em> deck using the Lasombra clan, with the {{ DOM }}{{ OBT }} disciplines.
    During the beginning, it uses {{ govern_the_unaligned }}
    to get vampires out faster and cheaper. When enough minions are into play, it switches to delivering
    strong bleed actions using {{ OBT }} for stealth.
</p>
<p>
    The deck uses {{ nocturn }} to protect its vampires from agression,
    but also to deliver more bleed in a single turn. At some point,
    {{ the_unmasking }} comes into play and makes them even better defenders.
</p>
<p>
    Stealth is high, with 14 stealth modifiers and
    {{ elysian_fields }} as a permanent enhancer.
</p>
<p>
    {{ deflection }} and {{ delaying_tactics }} defend against bleed and votes,
    and the deck uses no combat card at all, relying entirely on the
    {{ nocturn }} and stealth to avoid it.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    One or two {{ nocturn }} should be brought into play each turn.
    Keeping one in hand just to make sure it can be brought into play the next turn makes sense.
</p>
<p>
    {{ pentex_subversion }} can be used for the lunge if the prey has a strong blocker.
</p>
<p>
    {{ on_the_qui_vive }} can also be used by a {{ nocturn }} so it can bleed
    <em>and</em> block a rush action.
</p>
<p>
    {{ zaire_river_ferry }} is an additional stealth
    enhancer, plus it prevents rush actions: a nice combination.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    This example decklist uses an unusually high number of {{ nocturn }}.
    The <strong>Standard</strong> variant uses somewhere between 5 and 12 of them, and more
    {{ govern_the_unaligned }} and stealth modifiers.
    {{ moises_deck }} from 2020 is a good example.
</p>
<p>
    In a sense, the {{ kiasyd_stealth_bleed }} archetype can be seen as a variation
    of this one.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Black Hand</strong> variant uses groups 3 and 4 to include
    {{ henri_lavenant }} alongside {{ ermenegildo_the_rake }} and
    {{ banjoko }}, so it can use Black Hand cards like {{ tattoo_signal }},
    {{ watchtower_four_ride_forth }} and {{ remover }}.
    {{ johns_deck }} from 2016 is a good example.
