<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>powerbleed</em> deck of the Giovanni {{ giovanni }} clan. {{ DOM }}
    is used for bleeds and bounces, and {{ NEC }} for block denial, a bit of stealth
    and combat defence.
</p>
<p>
    As usual, the highest capacity vampire should be influenced first, so that
    {{ govern_the_unaligned }} can be used at superior {{ DOM }} to get more vampires
    out cheap and fast.
    Once it got three vampires ready, the deck proceeds with the bleeds, using
    {{ govern_the_unaligned }} at inferior {{ dom }}, plus modifiers for a bit of
    stealth, like {{ bonding }} and {{ spectral_divination }}.
</p>
<p>
    The deck has almost no defence against votes but, at the same time, most votes
    won't have too much of an impact on it. It still has a {{ delaying_tactics }} just
    in case, and {{ spectral_divination }} can always provide a bit of intercept if
    needed.
</p>
<p>
    The deck is fast and brutal. It does not have a lot of stealth but the vampires
    are cheap, so they're out fast and start bleeding early. {{ anarch_troublemaker }}
    and {{ pentex_subversion }} can help disable potential blockers, and a bit of
    stealth, plus block denial with {{ seduction }} and {{ call_of_the_hungry_dead }}
    can overcome most defences.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ trochomancy }} is an interesting modifier: not only does it enhance the bleeds,
    it is also a good counter against {{ ashur_tablets }} and {{ emerald_legionnaire }}.
</p>
<p>
    The cards tend to cost quite a lot of blood to the vampires: hence,
    {{ the_coven }}, {{ jake_washington }} and {{ perfectionist }} are included to
    regenerate a bit.
</p>
<p>
    The combat module is a mix of {{ spiritual_intervention }} and
    {{ breath_of_thanatos }}: the opponents will have to ponder the risk of the latter
    before coming in for a rush.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    A lot of minute changes can be considered:
    <li>
    {{ anarch_convert }} or {{ tupdog }} can help fluidify the crypt — and provide
    an expandable blocker against rushes.
    </li>
    <li>
    {{ misdirection }} can be added or replace either {{ anarch_troublemaker }}
    or {{ pentex_subversion }}. {{ the_uncoiling }} should be considered, if only
    to remove a cumbersome {{ the_unmasking }}.
    </li>
    <li>
    {{ command_of_the_beast }} can be added, just to make it hard for the opponents
    to get the potential bleed amount right.
    </li>
    <li>
    One or two {{ sudario_refraction }} can help fetch the right cards at the right
    moment — although it won't help against strong blockers.
    </li>
    <li>
    {{ acquired_ventrue_assets }} can be added as yet another way to regenerate a bit
    of blood.
    </li>
</p>
<p>
    The Giovanni {{ giovanni }} have great allies that can come in handy, like
    {{ tye_cooper }}, {{ ambrosius }}, {{ puppeteer }}, 
    {{ felix }} and {{ leonardo }}. Including them might render
    {{ breath_of_thanatos }} more versatile and provide a welcome anti-rush defence,
    but might also need a bit of protection with a couple of {{ far_mastery }} to get
    them back if they're stolen: all in all it's good support but can also hurt the card
    flow.
