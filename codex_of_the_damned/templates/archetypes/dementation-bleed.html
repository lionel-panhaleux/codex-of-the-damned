<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>stealth & bleed</em> deck using the {{ dem }}{{ obf }} disciplines.
    The idea is to bring maximum pool damage to the prey as fast as possible.
</p>
<p>
    Stealth is very high, with many {{ OBF }} and a few {{ dem }} modifiers.
    Many vampires in the crypt have a native +1 bleed ability, and the deck includes
    a lot of {{ eyes_of_chaos }} to bring each bleed to a potential 4 or 5.
    It also includes a good number of {{ touch_of_clarity }}, for a good chance of
    cancelling a {{ deflection }} and making sure the bleeds actually land.
</p>
<p>
    Two thirds of the vampires have {{ AUS }}, so {{ telepathic_misdirection }} can be
    used against bleeds. Nonetheless, the deck still includes {{ narrow_minds }},
    with the idea that it will hurt the prey much more than it hurts the deck itself.
</p>
<p>
    {{ kindred_spirits }} provides some bloat by itself and, coupled to a few
    {{ villein }}, this should let the deck get three or even four vampires out.
</p>
<p>
    When it comes down to combat, the deck relies on {{ no_trace }} to end them, but
    also packs a lot of {{ secure_haven }} and {{ secret_passage }} to avoid rushes.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    Compared to other {{ dem }} bleed variants, this deck takes its time. It is supposed
    to set things up calmly, taking the time to protect the main vampire (with the bleed
    bonus) with a {{ secure_haven }} or {{ secret_passage }}. It includes a few
    {{ spying_mission }} so that it can cancel a huge bleed being bounced if necessary:
    it would otherwise help the prey if carelessly allowed to hit the grandprey.
</p>
<p>
    The couple of {{ wash }} should be kept in hand for the lunge: a well-timed counter
    on a {{ villein }} can amount to a bleed of 5. It can also counter a permanent
    intercept location like {{ krcg_news_radio }}.
</p>
<p>
    {{ dreams_of_the_sphinx }} helps with cards rotation
    and avoid jamming the hand with stealth if the prey chooses not to block.
    {{ touch_of_clarity }} might be pointless if the prey is not using {{ dom }}
    bounces, but note it can also be used defensivly to prevent a {{ dom }} or {{ pre }}
    bleed action. It should be discard if useless but one might want to keep an eye on
    the next prey: if the prey is not bouncing, chances are the grand prey will be a
    target pretty soon...
</p>
<p>

</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    Depending on what's expected, a few other cards could find their place in the deck.
    {{ the_call }} is a common inclusion, {{ hide_the_mind }} could be considered to
    have the possibility to also counter the widespread {{ AUS }} bounces like
    {{ telepathic_misdirection }}. Finally, a couple of {{ restructure }} can be added
    against allies.
</p>
<p>
    {{ louhi }} can give birth to interesting variations thanks to his ability,
    like in {{ pedros_deck }} from 2015: {{ villein }} are out of question since
    he'll need his blood for his ability, but {{ the_call }} can be used to compensate.
    The result is even slower, but, again, the availability of both {{ hide_the_mind }}
    and {{ touch_of_clarity }} can provide great lunge opportunities.
</p>
<p>
    The deck can be built with {{ DEM }} only, and lower capacity vampires,
    as in {{ bram_van_stappen_s_deck }} from the 2013 German NC. This is far faster,
    but also more fragile as the stealth gets lower and the vampires have no good
    solution against opposing combat modules.
