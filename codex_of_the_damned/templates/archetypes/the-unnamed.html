<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>stealth & bleed</em> deck starring {{ the_unnamed }}.
    The idea is to use his ability to bleed and bloat at the same time.
    {{ tend_the_flock }} is used to improve the bloat.
</p>
<p>
    At some point in the game, he gets {{ enkil_cog }} and
    {{ homunculus }}, allowing him to bleed again
    during another turn, doubling his bleed and bloat power.
</p>
<p>
    The versatile {{ instantaneous_transformation }}
    is a great asset and other options are included to let him unlock as much as possible:
    {{ homunculus }}, but also {{ eluding_the_arms_of_morpheus }},
    {{ mylan_horseed }} and {{ majesty }}.
    The more he unlocks, the less the Methusalah has to pay for the <em>Infernal</em> penalty.
</p>
<p>
    His threatening combat ability makes unlocking and trying to block a real threat —
    {{ sense_the_sin }} becomes more versatile than in most Baali decks.
</p>
<p>
    {{ flurry_of_action }} is rarely played overall, but very
    typical of this archetype. It lets {{ the_unnamed }}
    bleed and unlock with a single card, at no cost.
    A bleed enhancement action is less useful than
    it can be in other decks, since {{ sense_the_sin }}, {{ true_love_s_face }},
    {{ enkil_cog }} and {{ the_horde }} already provide enough bleed enhancement,
    and the deck rarely bleeds over 3 because of {{ archon_investigation }} anyway.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ rötschreck }} is a nice surprise that can disable quite
    any combat module if used with {{ the_unnamed }} ability when blocking.
</p>
<p>
    {{ infernal_servitor }} is a powerful bleeder
    and can even use {{ obf }} for some stealth.
    Moreover, it can be played twice in a turn, back-to-back.
</p>
<p>
    {{ shadow_of_the_beast }} and {{ kaymakli_fragment }} are rare inclusions and
    <em>Darby Keeney</em> comments they could be cut.
</p>
<p>
    {{ mask_of_a_thousand_faces }} is seldom played,
    but here it lets {{ the_unnamed }} "takeover" when
    someone unexpectedly blocks a sidekick.
</p>
<p>
    The whole deck tends to cost a bit of blood, so
    {{ perfectionist }} and {{ giant_s_blood }} are played to help restore
    {{ the_unnamed }}'s blood. {{ the_coven }} is also common.
</p>
<p>
    {{ i_am_legion }} is versatile: it can be used to counter
    some {{ aus }} intercept or bounces
    but can also be used just for 1 pool on a successful action:
    the card text states <em>"and/<strong>or</strong> gain 1 pool"</em>.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    Many small variations exist over the minion cards.
    {{ form_of_mist }} is often included for its versatility.
    and {{ d_habi_revenant }} as a bleed enhancer.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Legal</strong> variant disregards the
    {{ enkil_cog }} and {{ homunculus }} combination and replaces
    {{ flurry_of_action }} with {{ legal_manipulations }}.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Maleficia</strong> variant plays {{ maleficia }}
    and uses {{ psalm_of_the_damned }}, {{ greater_curse }} and/or
    {{ evil_eye }} to improve the deck.
    {{ fernando_naves_resck_s_deck }} from the 2017 Brazilian CCQ is a good example.
