<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is an Ahrimanes wall deck using group 4 Ahrimanes.
    Depending on the build, it can be a pure wall or more of a toolbox.
    The core concept is to use the rather classical {{ ani }} Intercept/Combat combination
    —
    {{ raven_spy }}, {{ cats_guidance }}, {{ aid_from_bats }} and {{ carrion_crows }}
    —
    combined with {{ spi }} intercept and combat enhancers:
    {{ falcons_eye }}, {{ speak_with_spirits }}, {{ ears_of_the_hare }} and
    {{ swiftness_of_the_stag }}.
</p>
<p>
    This is a slow play, slowing down the prey and predator and bloating a bit with
    Master cards, all the while bleeding when possible with {{ deep_song }}
    and dealing additional pool damage with {{ fame }} and {{ dragonbound }}.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    As Ahrimanes are Sabbat, they have access to {{ abbot }},
    an excellent intercept enhancer. Having {{ spi }} for intercept
    allows to drop the classical {{ raven_spy }} completely,
    although most builds of this archetype still include it, sometimes along
    {{ muricias_call }} and some other animal retainers.
</p>
<p>
    {{ spi }} also provides {{ engling_fury }}, an excellent
    blood regeneration tool which, along {{ taste_of_vitae }},
    helps the Master {{ leeching }} bloat module.
</p>
<p>
    The {{ ani }} combat module always includes some cards against weapon modules
    to be able to handle some {{ ivory_bow }}, {{ magnum }} or {{ sniper_rifle }}
    on the opponent side.
    To this effect and depending on the context, {{ drawing_out_the_beast }},
    {{ canine_horde }} or {{ terror_frenzy }} can be used.
</p>
<p>
    If allies are expected, {{ vultures_buffet }} can be preferred to {{ engling_fury }}
    and {{ entrancement }} can be added to the mix.
</p>
<h2>Creator Insights</h2>
<p>
    <em>Randal Rudstam</em> was kind enough to provide the following insights:
</p>
<p>
    Getting into the three player endgame is more of a priority
    than getting the first or second oust.
</p>
<p>
    A third way to play them is to go Anarch,
    remove {{ abbot }} for some {{ anarch_revolt }} and access to {{ field_training }}.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    The Muricia variant is a <em>wall</em> construct as given in example.
    Some may include {{ pre }} cards to help on the bleeding side,
    like {{ legal_manipulations }} and {{ aire_of_elation }}.
    {{ underbridge_stray }} is also a common inclusion,
    as well as {{ smiling_jack_the_anarch }}.
    {{ yoann_guyaders_deck }} from the 2013 French NC is a an exemple.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Howler</strong> variant is a group 2 build using
    {{ howler }} and {{ the_siamese }}.
    Group 2 vampires are a bit more expensive and do miss a bit of superior {{ ANI }},
    so it makes including some {{ animalism }} quite necessary. On the other hand,
    the slightly bigger capacity allows for the use of {{ sense_the_savage_way }} to
    increase intercept capabilities, and {{ PRE }} is more present
    and allows for a more aggressive bleed module.
    {{ miquels_deck }} from 2019
    is an example of this approach.
