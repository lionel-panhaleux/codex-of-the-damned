<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>toolbox</em> deck built around the Tremere clan
    and their {{ aus }}{{ dom }}{{ tha }} disciplines.
    {{ dom }} is used to bleed, bounce bleeds and accelerate the crypt with
    {{ govern_the_unaligned }} and {{ scouting_mission }}.
    {{ aus }} is used for wakes, intercept and bounces.
    {{ tha }} is used for combat and a bit of stealth with {{ mirror_walk }}.
</p>
<p>
    As the deck does not have much stealth, it uses <em>powerbleed</em> tools
    to lock the prey vampires and make sure they won't be able to block or bounce,
    with {{ misdirection }}, {{ anarch_troublemaker }} and {{ pentex_subversion }}.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ theft_of_vitae }} is an excellent combat card, as it usually produces
    a 4 blood differential for no cost. Against some modules though, it can be a bit weak.
    The use of {{ apportation }} and {{ blood_fury }} helps with that.
    It is great against weapons-oriented modules, and can be played when the opponent uses
    {{ immortal_grapple }}: it is a nasty surprise against {{ for }}{{ pot }} combat modules.
</p>
<p>
    Using {{ threats }} alongside {{ conditioning }} provides some
    liberty of action if an opponent plays a {{ direct_intervention }}:
    the cancelled modifier cannot be played again on the same action, but another bleed enhancer can.
    The most direct advantage though is that it is cheaper and keeps more blood on the vampires.
</p>
<h2>Creator Insights</h2>
<p>
    <em>Daniel Gargulák</em> was kind enough to provide insights:
</p>
<p>
    Rotation is quite important in the deck.
    {{ the_barrens }}, {{ dreams_of_the_sphinx }} and {{ heart_of_nizchetus }}
    help in this regard.
</p>
<p>
    {{ misdirection }}, {{ anarch_troublemaker }} and {{ pentex_subversion }}
    should be kept in hand until it is time for the lunge.
</p>
<p>
    {{ theft_of_vitae }} is especially good because it handles {{ emerald_legionnaire }}
    and {{ nephandus }} easily. That's why there is only a single
    {{ far_mastery }} to handle the more rare werewolf allies.
</p>
<p>
    {{ blood_fury }} is a nice surprise: it is good in many situations,
    be it against weapons or against a {{ for }} wall, as both are common.
</p>
<p>
    When going for a bleed, {{ scouting_mission }} and
    {{ threats }} make sure that even a vampire with only 1 blood left
    can still get a bleed modifier, thus keeping the prey on her toes.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    The combat module can be adapted to the expected environment: aggravated damage with
    {{ flames_of_the_netherworld }} or {{ walk_of_flame }} is a commmon variation.
    {{ magic_of_the_smith }} is often see, to fetch a
    {{ bowl_of_convergence }}, {{ heart_of_nizchetus }} or {{ ivory_bow }}.
    Also, {{ ponticulus }} is often included for defence.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Royalty</strong> variant uses <em>Princes</em> and <em>Justicars</em>,
    adding political actions and {{ second_tradition_domain }} to the mix.
    {{ ricardo_molina_sobreira_s_deck }} from the 2018 SAC is a good example.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Infernal</strong> variant uses
    {{ valerius_maior_hell_s_fool_adv }} instead of {{ carna_the_princess_witch }}.
    His ability is fearsome and its <em>Infernal</em> trait and {{ DAI }}
    give him access to good options like
    {{ flames_of_the_netherworld }} and {{ unleash_hell_s_fury }}.
    {{ pau_vilar_s_deck }} from 2018 is a good example.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>V5</strong> variant uses new Tremere {{ tremere }} vampires from the
    {{ v5_tremere }} starter, as in {{ jose_luis_deck }} from 2021. It appears that
    the disciplines spread in groups 5 and 6 are good enough to replicate
    the archetype there.
