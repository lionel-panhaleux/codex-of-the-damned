<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>stealth & bleed</em> deck using the Lasombra clan, with the {{ DOM }}{{ OBT }} disciplines.
    During the beginning, it uses {{ govern_the_unaligned }}
    to get vampires out faster and cheaper. When enough minions are into play, it switches to delivering
    strong bleed actions using {{ OBT }} for stealth.
</p>
<p>
    The deck uses {{ nocturn }} to deliver more bleed faster, but they can also be used
    to protect the vampires from aggression if needed.
    In this version, {{ empowering_the_puppet_king }} can even be used to enhance their bleeds.
</p>
<p>
    Stealth is not that pervasive, with only 12 stealth modifiers and
    {{ elysian_fields }} as a permanent enhancer. On the other hand, this version stacks all there is
    on enhancing the bleed power itself, and can regularily bleed for 7, with a complete disregard
    for the rare {{ archon_investigation }}.
</p>
<p>
    {{ deflection }} and {{ delaying_tactics }} defend against bleed and votes,
    and the deck also uses a minimal combat module, with avoidance like {{ oubliette }}
    and deterrence with {{ entombment }}.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    With the highest bleed power one can pack, this deck is all about the lunge,
    so it's all about timing. The plan is to use a couple of {{ govern_the_unaligned }} first
    to get some vampires out, and some deflections to bounce the predator's bleed, until
    one can reach the necessary mass to secure the oust of the prey.
</p>
<p>
    The proportions of stealth, bleed enhancement, and combat, should be adapted to the meta
    for the deck to have any chance to work.
</p>
<p>
    This version is very punitive towards decks that have low defenses and plans to win fast.
    {{ the_bitter_and_sweet_story }} allows to capitalize on a fast game if it's drawn.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    This example decklist packs an unusually high bleed power.
    It's not unusual to see more stealth modifiers. {{ the_admonitions }} is also often
    included in that case to provide a bit more cycling in case the prey opts to not
    block at all. Whether or not to include {{ seduction }} is heavily meta-dependant.
</p>
<p>
    In a sense, the {{ kiasyd_stealth_bleed }} archetype can be seen as a variation
    of this one.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Black Hand</strong> variant uses groups 3 and 4 to include
    {{ henri_lavenant }} alongside {{ ermenegildo_the_rake }} and
    {{ banjoko }}, so it can use Black Hand cards like {{ tattoo_signal }},
    {{ watchtower_four_ride_forth }} and {{ remover }}.
    {{ johns_deck }} from 2016 is a good example.
