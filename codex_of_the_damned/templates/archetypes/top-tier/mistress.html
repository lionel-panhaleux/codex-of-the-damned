<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>bleed & vote</em> deck starring {{ mistress_fanchon }}.
    Her ability lets her fetch an {{ alastor }} to equip with
    an {{ helicopter }}, paying only 1 pool.
</p>
<p>
    {{ villein }}, {{ zillah_s_valley }} and {{ information_highway }} are used to get
    multiple big capacity vampires into play.
</p>
<p>
    This version uses only the {{ DOM }}{{ OBF }} disciplines, a dreadful combination.
    {{ obedience }} and {{ mental_maze }} are used for combat defence.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    The key idea of this archetype is to abuse {{ mistress_fanchon }}'s ability
    to fetch the right card at the right time. But she's not absolutely required here:
    the sidekicks can perform pretty well by themselves, and with {{ ashur_tablets }}
    in the mix, managing to get the right card at the right time is still very much
    a possibility.
</p>
<p>
    The deck is slow-paced, an this version includes no {{ a_b }} enhancement.
    So it's all about keeping a low profile, and timing the lunge well.
    The deck is surprisingly resilient and, if it manages to avoid the table's attention,
    it has all the flexibility it needs to fetch a couple of victory points in the end game.
</p>
<p>
    {{ scourge_of_the_enochians }} is included to cripple breed constructs,
    as they can be overwhelming for this slower deck.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    The use of {{ obedience }} for combat defense is very typical of this archetype, and
    some builds field twice the amount we see here: that depends a lot on the expected
    {{ meta }}. {{ a_b }} enhancer are a common inclusion too, like {{ rutors_hand }}
    and an {{ helicopter }} that can be fetched with {{ alastor }}
    or {{ magic_of_the_smith }}.
</p>
<p>
    The inclusion of {{ ashur_tablets }}, on the other hand, is pretty rare,
    but if you are wondering if it is still bankable after the 2024 nerf,
    check out {{ matin_weinmayer_s_deck }}, which includes even more of them.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Malgorzata</strong> variant uses {{ malgorzata }} as a star.
    It enhances the bloat possibilities of the deck and can open up the possibility of
    using Vicissitude {{ VIC }} for stealth or combat.
    Interestingly, it seems there is a spectrum between this archetype
    and the pure {{ malgorzata_archetype }}, more than a definite difference.
    We chose to keep the "mistress" archetype to the one with purely defensive combat,
    where you could expect a real "malgorzata" to use Vicissitude {{ VIC }}
    for aggravated damage.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Possession</strong> variant is a nice combination, played by {{ danilo_torrisi_in_2018 }}:
    The {{ might_of_the_camarilla }} alongside {{ possession }}
    to get more Inner Circle into play fast and cheap.
