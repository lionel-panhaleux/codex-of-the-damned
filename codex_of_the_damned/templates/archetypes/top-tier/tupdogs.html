<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is an <em>rush</em> deck using {{ tupdogs }} and {{ rock_cat }} to take down opposing vampires,
    then {{ graverobbing }} to steal them. It uses simple bleed for one from its own vampires as well
    as the stolen ones to oust its prey.
</p>
<p>
    The combat is dominated by the {{ tupdogs }} and their {{ VIC }} and {{ POT }}
    cards combination, using {{ brick_by_brick }} to set the range if needed,
    {{ immortal_grapple }} to prevent Dodge and Combat Ends, and {{ raking_talons }}
    for aggravated damage. {{ torn_signpost }} and {{ target_vitals }} can provide
    additional damage if needed.
</p>
<p>
    The {{ rock_cat }} are also good combat ends and can use {{ pot }} cards too. Contrarily to the {{ tupdog }},
    they stay in place and can rush every turn, consolidating the deck's control on the table even though
    opponents also get pool from {{ autarkis_persecution }}. Moreover, they can get recruited by a {{ tupdog }}
    even with no Tremere Antitribu in play, as early as turn 1.
</p>
<p>
    The critical part of the deck is to get a couple of Tremere antitribu {{ tremere_antitribu }} out fast,
    so that the {{ tupdogs }} can rush, and {{ deflection }} and {{ graverobbing }} can be played.
</p>
<p>
    {{ as_the_crow }} allows {{ tupdog }} to unlock so they can call {{ autarkis_persecution }}
    or recruit {{ rock_cat }} on top of a rush. Using {{ tupdog }} to call the vote makes it unappealing for anyone
    to block.
</p>
<p>
    The core issue of the deck is the high pool cost. {{ tupdogs }} only last a single
    turn and the deck should get one out every turn at least for safety and control.
    Plus the {{ rock_cat }} are 4 pool a piece, and the deck aims to recruit at least 4 to 6.
    {{ autarkis_persecution }} is the main tool to bloat, supported by {{ ashur_tablets }}.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    Disabling voters then blockers is a priority, so {{ graverobbing }} and {{ autarkis_persecution }} can be played.
    {{ graverobbing }} should be used on titled vampires first to help the votes get through later on.
    Cross-table voters might be pressured to let the vote pass by threatening them with a grave rob if they do not
    comply, but one must try not to alienate the whole table too fast: the deck is fragile in the beginning.
</p>
<p>
    To support the swarm strategy of the deck, influencing multiple vampires on top of a couple of {{ tupdog }}
    every turn is key. Master cards provide one more transfer, with {{ dreams_of_the_sphinx }},
    {{ information_highway }} or {{ powerbase_montreal }}.
</p>
<p>
    {{ secure_haven }} is included to contest if an opponent plays it.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    The <strong>Nephandus</strong> variant uses {{ nephandus }} to bleed and defend.
    It is a less aggressive, but also requires less bloat and does not rely on {{ autarkis_persecution }}.
    See {{ jorge_delgado_s_deck }} for an example. You might want to read {{ tommis_article }}
    about that variant, it goes a bit more in details on how to build and play it.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Dominate</strong> variant also forgoes the {{ rock_cat }} and {{ autarkis_persecution }},
    and instead includes a solid {{ dom }} bleed module to oust faster.
    This makes {{ unleash_the_hounds }} a neat inclusion, see {{ jukka_pekka_vainiola_s_deck }} for an example.
