<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>stealth & bleed</em> deck using V5 Malkavians, with the {{ DOM }}{{ OBF }} disciplines.
    During the beginning, it uses {{ govern_the_unaligned }}
    to get vampires out faster and cheaper. When enough minions are into play, it switches to delivering
    strong bleed actions using {{ OBF }} for stealth.
</p>
<p>
    The deck uses {{ deflection }} or the occasional {{ aus }} bounce to redirect bleeds to its prey and
    {{ delaying_tactics }} to defend against votes. It has virtually no combat defence,
    focusing solely on raw and brutal bleed power with an unusually high count of
    {{ govern_the_unaligned }} and {{ conditioning }}.
</p>
<p>
    Stealth is exceptionnaly high, with a third of the cards being stealth action modifiers or block denials,
    and a couple of tactical Master cards on top to limit the number of potential blockers: {{ pentex_subversion }},
    {{ misdirection }} and {{ anarch_troublemaker }}.
</p>
<p>
    The master module provides multiple cycling tools to enhance the card flow and avoid being jammed by the numerous
    stealth cards: a good number of {{ dreams_of_the_sphinx }} of course, but also {{ the_barrens }} and
    {{ elder_library }}
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    Timing is critical when playing this deck: going forward too hard and too soon against the prey can cripple her
    too badly and ultimately advantage a cross-table opponent too much and give them the game. The whole idea is to
    clamly get 4 vampires out with {{ govern_the_unaligned }}, giving time to the opponents to develop and get their
    game underway, before slamming down the hammer of 4-6 bleeds on the table.
</p>
<p>
    A key difficulty for this deck is to avoid ousting its grand-prey by mistake because of a bounce on a high-stealth
    strong bleed. Hence the good number of {{ spying_mission }}: it can be used at superior {{ OBF }} to avoid damaging
    a non-prey opponent. {{ hide_the_mind }} participates to the same logic by providing a tactical counter against
    {{ AUS }} bounces like {{ telepathic_misdirection }}.
</p>
<p>
    {{ wash }} is a bleed in disguise: its point is to cancel bloat Master cards like {{ villein }}, {{ blood_doll }}
    or {{ liquidation }}. But it can obviously also be very useful to prevent a permanent intercept location like
    {{ krcg_news_radio }} or big threats from the opponent like {{ haqims_law_retribution }}.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    This build is a variant of the good old {{ malk_94 }} archetype, celebrating the return of Dominate {{ DOM }}
    as a clan discipline for Malkavians. The proportion of stealth has to be adapted to the meta,
    and wether or not to include combat defense like {{ no_trace }} and {{ secure_haven }}
    really depends on the expected opposition.
</p>
<p>
    A bit more defense can be added to the mix with {{ carlton_van_wyk }} and {{ muddled_vampire_hunter }} if one bets
    on {{ entrancement }} or {{ far_mastery }} being rare inclusions in the opponents decks. {{ heart_of_nizchetus }}
    is definitely an option to help with the card flow and {{ vessel }} can be considered to better manage the
    blood-pool repartition. All in all, the deck can be more compact and stand comfortably in the 72-82 range.
    See for example {{ javier_naranjos_deck }} for an alternate take on the archetype.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Toolbox</strong> variant features a bit more range, with some weapons-based combat and politics,
    like in {{ isaac_domínguez_deck }}. It is less forward-focused, but also more flexible.
