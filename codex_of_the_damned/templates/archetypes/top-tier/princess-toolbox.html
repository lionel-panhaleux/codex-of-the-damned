<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>toolbox</em> deck built around the Tremere clan
    and their {{ aus }}{{ dom }}{{ tha }} disciplines.
    {{ dom }} is used to bleed, bounce bleeds and accelerate the crypt with
    {{ govern_the_unaligned }}.
    {{ aus }} is used for wakes, intercept and bounces.
    {{ tha }} is used for combat and a bit of stealth with {{ mirror_walk }}.
</p>
<p>
    {{ magic_of_the_smith }} is central to this deck: it allows the vampire to fetch
    the right equipment early in the game. Going for the {{ heart_of_nizchetus }} is the
    default option, but the {{ bowl_of_convergence }} can be required fast
    if the predator uses a lot of stealth, and the right weapon can make all the difference,
    in particular a {{ sniper_rifle }} if some Potence {{ pot }} makes you weary of {{ immortal_grapple }}.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ theft_of_vitae }} is an excellent combat card, as it usually produces
    a 4 blood differential for no cost. {{ movement_of_the_mind }} helps keep things at range,
    and {{ rego_motum }} helps with damage, especially aggravated damage from {{ pro }} or {{ vic }}.
    It is a resilient and versatile grinder module: the point is not to disable the blocked vampires,
    but rather make them lose blood in the effort consistently.
</p>
<p>
    The use of {{ oliver_thrace }} as a sidekick here is a neat trick, very dependant on the meta.
    His ability completely ruins {{ form_of_mist }} and {{ earth_meld }}, which are common inclusions
    in both Ministry {{ ministry }} and Gangrel {{ gangrel }} decks.
</p>
<p>
    The deck fields a stupendous amount of bounces for additional security, but they also help put
    additional pressure on the prey, given the predator bleeds decently. As the game progresses,
    the deck becomes only more resilient, with permanent intercept and weapons installed.
    {{ eagles_sight }} can make or break the game by allowing the unexpected block of the right action,
    using them properly requires skill and a good grasp of the table balance, but can be key to secure game wins.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    The combat module can be adapted to the expected environment: aggravated damage with
    {{ flames_of_the_netherworld }} or {{ walk_of_flame }} is a commmon variation.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Royalty</strong> variant uses <em>Princes</em> and <em>Justicars</em>,
    adding political actions and {{ second_tradition_domain }} to the mix.
    {{ ricardo_molina_sobreira_s_deck }} from the 2018 SAC is a good example.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Infernal</strong> variant uses
    {{ valerius_maior_hell_s_fool_adv }} instead of {{ carna_the_princess_witch }}.
    His ability is fearsome and its <em>Infernal</em> trait and {{ DAI }}
    give him access to good options like
    {{ flames_of_the_netherworld }} and {{ unleash_hell_s_fury }}.
    {{ pau_vilar_s_deck }} from 2018 is a good example.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>V5</strong> variant uses new Tremere {{ tremere }} vampires from the
    {{ v5_tremere }} starter, as in {{ jose_luis_deck }} from 2021. It appears that
    the disciplines spread in groups 5 and 6 are good enough to replicate
    the archetype there.
