<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>toolbox</em> deck built around the Tremere clan
    and their {{ aus }}{{ dom }}{{ tha }} disciplines.
</p>
<p>
    {{ magic_of_the_smith }} is central: it allows the vampire to fetch
    the right equipment early in the game. Going for the {{ heart_of_nizchetus }} is the
    default option, but the {{ bowl_of_convergence }} can be required fast
    if the predator uses a lot of stealth, and the right weapon can make all the difference,
    in particular a {{ sniper_rifle }} if some Potence {{ pot }} deck threatens {{ immortal_grapple }}.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ theft_of_vitae }} is an excellent combat card, as it usually produces
    a 4 blood differential for no cost. {{ rego_motum }} helps with damage, especially aggravated damage
    from {{ pro }} or {{ vic }}.
    It is a resilient and versatile grinder module: the point is not to disable the blocked vampires,
    but rather make them lose blood in the effort consistently.
</p>
<p>
    The deck fields a stupendous amount of bounces for additional security, but they also help put
    additional pressure on the prey, if the predator bleeds decently. As the game progresses,
    the deck becomes only more resilient, with permanent intercept and weapons installed.
    {{ eagles_sight }} can make or break the game by allowing the unexpected block of the right action,
    using them properly requires skill and a good grasp of the table balance, but can be key to secure game wins.
</p>
<p>
    This version focuses on weapons, including a couple of {{ anonymous_freight }} to fetch those which where drawn
    before {{ magic_of_the_smith }} could be played.
    {{ smiling_jack_the_anarch }} is tripled to try and secure the key ousting mechanism.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    The combat module can be adapted to the expected environment: aggravated damage with
    {{ flames_of_the_netherworld }} or {{ walk_of_flame }} is a commmon variation.
    {{ ponticulus }} is a common inclusion, as well as {{ nra_pac }}.
</p>
<p>
    This version is more of a wall. The <strong>Toolbox</strong> version includes {{ govern_the_unaligned }}
    to influence more vampires faster and cheaper, and bleed later with a bit of stealth in {{ mirror_walk }}
    or even {{ bonding }}, and the occasional {{ conditioning }} for the lunge.
    See for example {{ jan_liska_s_deck }}.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Royalty</strong> variant uses <em>Princes</em> and <em>Justicars</em>,
    adding political actions and {{ second_tradition_domain }} to the mix.
    {{ ricardo_molina_sobreira_s_deck }} from the 2018 SAC is a good example.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Infernal</strong> variant uses
    {{ valerius_maior_hell_s_fool_adv }} instead of {{ carna_the_princess_witch }}.
    His ability is fearsome and its <em>Infernal</em> trait and {{ DAI }}
    give him access to good options like
    {{ flames_of_the_netherworld }} and {{ unleash_hell_s_fury }}.
    {{ pau_vilar_s_deck }} from 2018 is a good example.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>V5</strong> variant uses new Tremere {{ tremere }} vampires from the
    {{ v5_tremere }} starter, as in {{ jose_luis_deck }} from 2021. It appears that
    the disciplines spread in groups 5 and 6 are good enough to replicate
    the archetype there.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Oliver</strong> variant uses {{ oliver_thrace }} as a co-star.
    His ability completely ruins {{ form_of_mist }} and {{ earth_meld }}, which are common inclusions
    in both Ministry {{ ministry }} and Gangrel {{ gangrel }} decks. So, depending on the meta,
    that might be a judicious choice. See {{ antonio_cobo_cuenca_s_deck }} for reference.
