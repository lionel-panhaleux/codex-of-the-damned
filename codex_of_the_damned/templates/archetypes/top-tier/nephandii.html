<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This an <em>Allies swarm</em> deck relying on the excellent {{ nephandus }},
    coupled with their preferred recruiter, {{ antonio_d_erlette }}.
</p>
<p>
    The deck aims at recruiting at least one {{ nephandus }} a turn, sometimes two by using {{ mirror_walk }}
    for stealth and protection against blocks, building a swarm of them to bleed their prey.
    The {{ nephandii }} ability makes them resilient and, with just {{ target_vitals }},
    they are painful for a low cost.
</p>
<p>
    On the defense side, the deck uses {{ deflection }} against bleeds and {{ delaying_tactics }}
    against votes. It aims at playing {{ the_unmasking }} as soon as possible, to allow
    the {{ nephandii }} to provide better protection.
</p>
<p>
    The deck uses the {{ liquidation }} & {{ ashur_tablets }} combination to bloat,
    and {{ the_shard }} for cost reduction.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    The occasional {{ haven_uncovered }} and {{ frontal_assault }} allow for spikes of rushes from the {{ nephandii }},
    that can swing the whole table balance.
</p>
<p>
    {{ secure_haven }} can protect {{ antonio_d_erlette }} from rushes.
    Otherwise, a second vampire to provide a bit of resilience in {{ deflection }} works, as any decent
    {{ stealth_bleed }} deck will be able to pass the {{ nephandii }} if noone is bouncing.
</p>
<p>
    The 3 {{ tupdog }} in crypt are an interesting inclusion. They can serve as meat shields
    to protect {{ antonio_d_erlette }} in the first turn, but they can also mislead the opponents in mistaking
    the deck for a {{ tupdog_arch }} deck, an for quite a long time if the player manages to keep the charade going,
    since using {{ nephandii }} is a strong variant of that archetype.
</p>
<p>
    {{ dreams_of_the_sphinx }} is useful to cycle out the multiple copies of unique cards and keep the cards flowing,
    and it can occasionally gain a turn when drawn first, with {{ antonio_d_erlette }} being capacity 5.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    Since he built the deck first, {{ darby_keeney_s_list }} and his comments are worth a look.
    For example, he does not bother with {{ fbi_special_affairs_division }}, {{ secure_haven }},
    nor {{ archon_investigation }}. That said, these are all worth consideration depending on the {{ meta }}.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Bounce</strong> variant, introduced by {{ martin_weinmayer }},
    uses a different crypt with more superior Auspex {{ AUS }}, aiming for a sidekick who can block with
    {{ sniper_rifle }}. It fields so many bounces, the deck is virtually impregnable to bleeds.
    It is a slower but more resilient deck, fit for a bleed-heavy {{ meta }}.
