<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>stealth & bleed</em> deck using the {{ dem }}{{ obf }} disciplines
    and middle to low capacity vampires. The idea is to bring maximum pool damage
    to the prey as fast as possible.
</p>
<p>
    Stealth is very high, using {{ confusion }} and multiple {{ obf }}
    and {{ dem }} modifiers.
</p>
<p>
    Some vampires have {{ AUS }}, so {{ telepathic_misdirection }} can be used against
    bleeds. {{ delaying_tactics }} and {{ poison_pill }} are used against votes.
</p>
<p>
    {{ kindred_spirits }} provides some bloat and
    {{ madman_s_quill }} can be used for the lunge.
</p>
<p>
    The deck is very fast, but a bit fragile. There is no combat module,
    and a strong combat deck can become an issue.
    It is compensated by the fact the deck is fast.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ leverage }} is used to keep the opponents guessing about
    the actual bleed power of the deck, adding just a point of bleed for an eventual lunge.
</p>
<p>
    The disciplines are not so well distributed in the crypt:
    {{ obfuscate }}, {{ dementation }} and
    {{ dive_into_madness }} can be used to fix this.
</p>
<p>
    {{ dreams_of_the_sphinx }} and {{ heart_of_nizchetus }} help with cards rotation
    and avoid jamming the hand with stealth if the prey chooses not to block.
</p>
<p>
    {{ poison_pill }} is an interesting alternative to {{ delaying_tactics }} in a weenie
    deck: it does not cost a blood, which is better as blood is a rare resource in this deck,
    plus it is an excellent counter to high damage anti-weenie votes like
    {{ anarchist_uprising }}, {{ ancilla_empowerment }} and {{ domain_challenge }}.
</p>
<p>
    Only one copy of each vampire in the crypt makes sure that each draw on the crypt will get a
    vampire that can be brought into play.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    There are many small variations of this archetype.
    {{ restructure }} (against ally), {{ enchanted_marionette }}
    and {{ telepathic_counter }} (because {{ narrow_minds }} can cripple
    {{ telepathic_misdirection }}) are sometimes included.
    More {{ wash }} and {{ sudden_reversal }} can be included,
    sometimes even {{ bleeding_the_vine }},
    to counter Master bloat cards like {{ villein }} and
    improve the deck forward pressure.
</p>
<p>
    Bigger capacity vampires can be used like in {{ norbert_broda_s_deck }} from 2015.
    A stable access to {{ OBF }} and {{ AUS }}gives them better stealth and let them use
    {{ the_call }} and {{ no_trace }} for combat defence,
    although the deck gets a bit slower.
</p>
<p>
    Lower capacity vampires can be used, dropping {{ obf }} entirely
    to rely exclusively on {{ DEM }}, as in {{ bram_van_stappen_s_deck }}
    from the 2013 German NC. This is an even faster variation,
    but more fragile as the stealth gets lower and the vampires
    have more chances to get blocked.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, a more stable crypt can be used, like in {{ pawel_kosz_s }} deck from 2011,
    but {{ wider_view }} is included to help with crypt rotation in this case.
