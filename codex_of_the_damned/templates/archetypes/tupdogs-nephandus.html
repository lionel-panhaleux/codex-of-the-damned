<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is an <em>rush</em> deck using {{ tupdogs }} to take down opposing vampires
    and {{ nephandus }} to bleed and defend. {{ antonio_d_erlette }} is the star
    in a sense, since his ability provides sure {{ nephandus }}
    recruitments with no risk of block.
</p>
<p>
    The combat is dominated by the {{ tupdogs }} and their {{ VIC }} and {{ POT }}
    cards combination, using {{ brick_by_brick }} to set the range if needed,
    {{ immortal_grapple }} to prevent Dodge and Combat Ends, and {{ raking_talons }}
    for aggravated damage. {{ torn_signpost }} and {{ target_vitals }} can provide
    additional damage if needed.
</p>
<p>
    The {{ nephandus }} themselves are not too shabby in combat, especially since 
    they can use {{ haven_uncovered }} to rush and {{ target_vitals }} to inflict more
    damage.
</p>
<p>
    The critical part of the deck is to get a Tremere antitribu {{ tremere_antitribu }}
    out, so that the {{ tupdogs }} can rush, {{ nephandus }} can be recruited and
    {{ deflection }} played. {{ antonio_d_erlette }} is best,
    he can even allow two {{ nephandus }} to hit the table in a single turn.
</p>
<p>
    The core issue of the deck is the high pool cost. {{ tupdogs }} only last a single
    turn and the deck should get one out every turn at least for safety and control.
    Plus the {{ nephandus }} are 2 pool a piece, and the deck aims to recruit 4 to 6.
    This makes the {{ ashur_tablets }} and {{ the_parthenon }} combination a perfect fit
    for the deck: it will bring a bit of pool back and provide a nice recursion to shape
    the deck and its combat module according to the table.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    To make use of {{ antonio_d_erlette }}'s ability and influence a {{ tupdog }} in
    the same turn, more than 4 transfers are necessary. Master cards provide one more
    transfer, with {{ dreams_of_the_sphinx }},
    {{ information_highway }} or {{ powerbase_montreal }}.
</p>
<p>
    Vote decks can be an issue here, as pool is scarce and quite a few minions can be
    out at the same time: {{ anarchist_uprising }} and {{ ancilla_empowerment }}
    might oust the deck swiftly. To cover this, the deck uses {{ delaying_tactics }} 
    and {{ yawp_court }}.
</p>
<p>
    {{ direct_intervention }} should be kept in hand to counter anti-ally actions
    like {{ entrancement }}, or problematic "one shot" votes like {{ reins_of_power }}.
</p>
<p>
    You might want to read {{ tommis_article }} about this specific archetype, it goes
    a bit more in details on how to build and play it.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    The <strong>Naked</strong> variant does not rely on the {{ ashur_tablets }}
    inclusion and instead use {{ failsafe }} for a bit of additional pool, like in
    {{ filipes_deck }} from 2014.
    In an environment where the {{ ashur_tablets }} module is likely to become
    a competition, this might be a better bet. That said, Martin's Weinmayer combination
    here is considered more stable and powerful overall.
</p>
<p>
    Although this is a different archetype, {{ nephandus }} can also be used without
    the {{ tupdogs }}, like in {{ Lukasz_deck }} from 2013. This is more of a toobox
    but it has fallen a bit out of fashion since the apparition of
    {{ emerald_legionnaire }} and the invention of the deck listed here.
