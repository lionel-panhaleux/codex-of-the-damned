<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
	This is a <em>rush</em> deck based on mid-cap {{ POT }} vampires.
</p>
<p>
	Ordinary rush deck uses {{ ANI }} as the key discipline because {{ deep_song }}
	is both the means to rush and the means to oust the prey. Other {{ combat }} decks
	can enter combat using vampires' special action, like {{ beast_leatherface }} for
	example.
</p>
<p>
	There is no alternative to {{ deep_song }} for {{ POT }} decks and there are only
	two Nosferatu {{ img_clan_nosferatu }} able to enter combat as a special action:
	{{ ebanezer_roush }} and {{ gustave_brunnelle }}.
</p>
<p>
	This means that the deck uses {{ bums_rush }} as a means to rush and
	{{ creeping_sabotage }} as a means to oust the prey.
</p>

<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
	As {{ creeping_sabotage }} only deals damage to the prey, it is less likely that other
	players will try to use actions to destroy it. {{ bums_rush }} can then be used to
	reduce the number of {{ actions }} that the prey can use to attempt to destroy it.
</p>
<p>
	If a prey or a predator has a good {{ range_management }} capability, {{ stealth }} can
	be used to secure the optional maneuver from {{ bums_rush }}.
</p>
<p>
	Using {{ the_warrens }} early in the game can dissuade some Methuselah to use actions
	to attempt to destroy {{ creeping_sabotage }}.
</p>
<p>
	There are some flex slots in the combat module that deals with ranged combat:
	{{ thrown_sewer_lid }}, {{ slam }}, {{ earthshock }}, {{ improvised_tactics }}. Choosing
	one over the others depends on what type of ranged fights you are expecting.
</p>

<h2>Tournament Version</h2>
<p>
	This deck has been inspired by two tournament archetypes: {{ nananimalism }} and
	{{ euro_brujah }}. Despite their different core discipline {{ ANI }} and {{ DOM }},
	the density of the {{ modules }} were of great help to design this deck.
</p>
<p>
	It can be possible to choose {{ ANI }} as the combat discipline using {{ aid_from_bats }}
	and {{Â carrion_crows }} to deal damage. The integration of {{ creeping_sabotage }} in
	{{ nananimalism }}'s game plan may be a development axis.
<p>
	It can also be possible to play a wall version of this deck using {{ AUS }} and/or
	{{ ANI }} to {{ intercept }} the directed actions against the {{ creeping_sabotage }}.
