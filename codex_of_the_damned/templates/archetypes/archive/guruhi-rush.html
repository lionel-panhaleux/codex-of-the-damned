<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>rush</em> deck using the {{ ANI }}{{ POT }} disciplines combination.
    {{ nana_buruku }} is used for additional Master actions,
    playing {{ ashur_tablets }} for recursion and {{ anarch_revolt }}
    for additional pool damage.
</p>
<p>
    {{ nangila_were }}, {{ enkidu_the_noah }} and/or {{ black_annis }}
    are used to rush the opponents minions
    and take them down with the powerful {{ ANI }}{{ POT }} combat module.
</p>
<p>
    {{ fame }} and {{ dragonbound }} are used to improve pool damage a bit.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ powerbase_luanda }} and {{ well_marked }} are nice tools
    for a <em>rush</em> deck.
</p>
<p>
    Just including a bit of <em>wakes</em> and some intercept enhancers like
    {{ cats_guidance }} and {{ sense_the_savage_way }}
    keeps the other players guessing on wether the deck can block or not.
</p>
<p>
    Getting {{ wider_view }} at some point helps rotating the crypt a little bit.
    {{ andre_le_roux }} is included as a bleed enhancer once all the prey's vampires
    are down.
</p>
<p>
    The combat module includes a lot of cards in single copy as specific counters.
    They're not likely to jam the hand and can be brought back by {{ ashur_tablets }}
    if need be.
</p>
<p>
    As the game moves along, the deck can use {{ ashur_tablets }} to concentrate
    the content of the deck on more bleed or more combat cards,
    depending on what's needed.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    This deck became notorious by winning the European Championship
    <strong>twice in a row</strong> in 2019 and 2022
    (Covid-19 had got the 20 and 21 editions postponed).
    It still made the finals in 23. It's undoubtedly the strongest variant,
    although arguably it only really shines in the hands of a a player of Otso's caliber.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Laibon</strong> variant does not go Anarch and can get more toolboxy,
    using {{ PRE }} for {{ enchant_kindred }} and the excellent
    {{ founders_of_the_ebony_kingdom }}.
    {{ grooming_the_protégé }} also helps getting vampires out faster.
    {{ michael_heyder_s_deck }} from the 2009 NAC is a good example.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Snake</strong> variant does not go Anarch either but uses Serpentis {{ ser }}
    as a support discipline, like {{ alessandro_donatis_deck }} from the 2023 Italian Tour.
    This allows for the inclusion of damage prevention with the excellent {{ typhonic_beast }}.
