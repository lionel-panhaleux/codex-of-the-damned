<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a Ministry {{ ministry }} <em>combo powerbleed</em> deck using {{ hesha_ruhadze }} as star.
    The goal is to influence {{ angel_chavarria }},
    fetch all the equipments possible using {{ hag_s_wrinkles }} to stealth and unlock,
    the influence {{ hesha_ruhadze }}, give him the equipments with {{ nod }} or {{ heidelberg }},
    so he can bleed for something like 20.
</p>
<p>
    This deck is a masterpiece of deckbuilding finesse, and has attracted a lot of attention when Sérgio Louçã Martins
    played it in the 2024 Atlantic Cup finals. He was first seed there, with a brutal 3GW13 score.
    Yes, this deck sweeps tables.
</p>
<p>
    At first sight, this thing is a crazy idea. What stops the prey to just bounce this awful bleed and simply win the
    game thanks to the help of their predator? Well, the deck has a few tricks:
    First it can check for bounces or an {{ archon_investigation }} with {{ monocle_of_clarity }}.
    Second, it can use {{ vial_of_elder_vitae }}, {{ the_textbook_damnation }}, {{ veneficorum_artum_sanguis }} and
    {{ ritual_goblet }} to have access to {{ dai }} and {{ tha }},
    so he can play {{ perfect_clarity }} and {{ i_am_legion }}. Of course, he can also use {{ hide_the_mind }}.
    As a last resort, {{ approximation_of_loyalty }} and {{ revelations }},
    that {{ angel_chavarria }} can play with a {{ vial_of_elder_vitae }}
</p>
<p>
    So, maybe you can just block him, right? But {{ hesha_ruhadze }} has a whole arsenal of block denial: with
    {{ flaming_candle }}, {{ concoction_of_vitality }} and {{ horrific_countenance }}, that's three bleeds
    that vampires cannot block, and that's enough to win the game.
</p>
<p>
    One would think you can just rush {{ hesha_ruhadze }} and be done with him then.
    But he has a {{ body_bag }} to be able to simply fail any rush attempt.
</p>
<p>
    Does it seem unlikely the deck gets all the cards it needs at the right time to be able to land his bleeds?
    Well, with {{ learjet }} and {{ angel_chavarria }} performing 20 or more actions on turn 2, no it's not.
    The deck can basically get all the equipments out in a turn or two,
    and construct the perfect lunge hand while doing it.
</p>
<p>
    Isn't it slow to set up? In fact, no, it's very fast. That deck can sweep tables in 20 minutes.
    {{ angel_chavarria }} gets a {{ learjet }} early during his {{ hag_s_wrinkles }} chain on turn 2,
    allowing him to plow through the deck and fetch a {{ kaymakli_fragment }} and {{ the_textbook_damnation }}:
    that's why they're both doubled in the deck. Once he has those, he can use {{ kaymakli_fragment }} to help bring
    {{ hesha_ruhadze }} immediately at the end of the turn. And the next turn should start with either a {{ nod }}
    or {{ heidelberg }} and {{ hesha_ruhadze }} can bleed for 20 or more on turn 3.
</p>
<h2>Considerations</h2>
<p>
    This is a piece of art but, of course, as well-designed as it is, it's still a pretty fragile combo deck.
    First, it can simply hit a bounce it cannot cancel. That's what happened during the Atlantic Cup finals.
    Given all the solutions against bounce the deck has, it's unlikely, but against {{ bait_and_switch }},
    it really only has {{ revelations }} and {{ approximation_of_loyalty }}.
</p>
<p>
    Second, the deck needs exact precision to be played: it has three unblockable bleeds to offer:
    {{ flaming_candle }}, {{ concoction_of_vitality }} and {{ horrific_countenance }}. To land them quickly,
    one needs to make the exact right choice on each {{ learjet }} discard and order all actions and card plays
    correctly. That sad, {{ the_sargon_fragment }} can still be used to bring back a card if not everything goes
    according to plan, so it is not completely flimsy.
</p>
<p>
    So, in the end, can this deck win a tournament? There's no doubt.
    And make sure to credit Sérgio for this beautiful build once you do.
    The problem, of course, could be to find enough {{ hag_s_wrinkles }} to build it: given it's a not-yet-reprinted
    rare, that might prove difficult.
