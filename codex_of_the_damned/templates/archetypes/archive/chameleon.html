<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a Ministry {{ ministry }} <em>combo</em> deck using {{ sergio_bueno }} as star.
    The goal is to use {{ chameleon }} to steal other vampires on the table, disabling everyone else by doing so,
    and finish off the preys with either with {{ revolutionary_council }} or just by bleeding.
</p>
<p>
    It is not easy to pull off {{ chameleon }} consistently multiple times. The card is expensive, of course,
    but also it can only target younger freshly arrived vampires. So you need a higher capacity vampire,
    and it needs to be there <em>before</em> your opponents influence theirs. And you have five opponents!
</p>
<p>
    Nonetheless, Teemu Sainomaa won the 2024 Atlantic Cup with this deck, and Otso Saariluoma happend to make the finals
    of the same tournament <em>with the same deck</em>, so it must at least have fitted the meta very well that day.
</p>
<p>
    Of course, there are a few tricks to it. Running a tight library, a <em>lot</em> of stealth to ensure
    {{ chameleon }} and the votes can go through, it aims to land a {{ heidelberg_castle }} early.
    The first few {{ chameleon }} will target any available vampire, with a preference for the prey or predator,
    a Baron if possible, titled otherwise, just an Anarch if nothing else.
    The blood goes back to {{ sergio }} through {{ heidelberg }} so he can {{ chameleon }} again the next turn.
</p>
<p>
    During the course of the game, {{ abombwe }} is used to increase {{ sergio }}'s capacity to 10, so that only
    the biggest vampires can hope to escape him. When running out of freshly influenced vampires, {{ sergio }} can
    simply use {{ banishment }} to remove the target and, if it's influenced anew, <em>then</em> it can be stolen
    with {{ chameleon }} immediately.
</p>
<h2>Considerations</h2>
<p>
    This is a dreadful deck you do not want to bring on a casual table if you want to keep your friends.
    It is fast and egregious and has very few blind spots. Using {{ chameleon }} to target other titled vampires as a
    priority, it gets the vote lock easily, even over dedicated Inner Circle builds like {{ lutz_politics }}.
    Those are probably the biggest threat to the deck though. Maybe it's worth including a {{ fear_of_mekhet }} or two?
</p>
<p>
    {{ garibaldi_meucci_museum }} is so strong here that it's been doubled. It can fetch a needed {{ chameleon }}
    or {{ revolutionnary_council }}, but also end a dangerous combat if some Anarch tries to take {{ sergio }} down.
</p>
<p>
    All in all it's a very strong, very hard to build, horribly crippling thing we have here.
    Was this only a lucky fluke because of an ideal {{ meta }} that was running too many mid-caps and not enough
    big caps? Or can this deck make it to the top tier in the next few months?
