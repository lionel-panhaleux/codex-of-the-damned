<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a Tremere {{ tremere }} <em>swarm</em> deck using {{ the_embrace }} to get more
    minions and bleed for one, getting around bounce and reduction defenses.
    The intersting trick here is it uses {{ powerbase_savannah }} to avoid combat, and {{ salt_of_thoth }}
    to protect the {{ powerbase_savannah }} itself.
</p>
<p>
    This funny contraption was brought to us by the inimitable <em>Bram Van Stappen</em>, who won a small Finnish
    tournament with it. Given the highly competitive meta there, and the infamous combat-heavy nature of it,
    it is an impressive achievement.
</p>
<p>
    The deck contains a lot of Locations to support the {{ powerbase_savannah }}, and a lot of {{ deflection }}
    to defend against strong bleeders. A bit of vote defense with {{ delaying_tactics }} and {{ poison_pill }},
    some Bram-typical {{ ashur_tablets }} recursion, a {{ gran_madre_di_dio }} just to contest it if it goes out,
    but also to provide yet an additional Location, and an {{ uncoiling }} to remove the incidental
    {{ scourge_of_the_enochians }}.
</p>
<h2>Considerations</h2>
<p>
    Now that swarms have falled a bit out of fashion thanks to {{ gangrel_thing }} and the {{ emerald_legionnaire }}
    nerf, opponents are lessed prepared to it. And if, normally, a combat-oriented meta could control this easily,
    {{ powerbase_savannah }} offers a really efficient response, jamming the hand of wall and grinder decks
    while also denying any removal from stealth deck with {{ salt_of_thoth }}.
    It also tailored against {{ gangrel_thing }} decks using {{ earth_meld }} for unlock,
    since {{ powerbase_savannah }} will prevent that card to be played altogether.
</p>
<p>
    So, is this thing strong, or it just just a fluke? Hard to tell: Bram is certainly a talented player,
    and him winning with this deck does not mean the lot us can. Additionally, a first win can often be credited
    to the opponents underestimating the deck or failing to foresee its mechanics. On the first confrontation,
    one would for sure underestimate the amount of combat {{ powerbase_savannah }} can end, and how difficult
    it would be to remove it because of the loads of {{ salt_of_thoth }} here.
</p>
<p>
    So maybe this can only win once as a surprise. But it won a tournament finals, so even knowing the deck,
    the finalists there couldn't best it. This might be worth trying and investigating and, who knows?
    Maybe it's the new swarm we're all going to worry about now.
