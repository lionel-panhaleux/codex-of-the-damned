<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a Multiclan Anarch <em>toolbox</em> deck using Animalism {{ ANI }} coupled with the powerful
    {{ organized_resistance }} Barons provide.
</p>
<p>
    It is one of the first tournament wins featuring the new V5 Tzimisce, and it was built by no other than
    Nina Nilsson, 2023 UK Grand Prix Champion.
</p>
<p>
    It does use the classical Animalism {{ ANI }} tools one would expect: {{ deep_song }} to be able to bleed or rush,
    and the classical {{ aid_from_bats }} & {{ carrion_crows }} module that made {{ nananimalism }} a force to recon.
</p>
<p>
    But here, thanks to the new Tzimisce {{ tzimisce }} Barons and Ravnos {{ ravnos }} sidekicks, it's a full Anarch
    version right off the bat, and it can use and egregious number of {{ organized_resistance }} and a couple
    {{ bait_and_switch }} to provide a strong defense on top.
</p>
<p>
    Not relying on {{ anarch_revolt }} for the oust with all the Anarchs lying around nowadays, it just uses
    {{ fame }} and {{ club_illusion }}. The Master module provides a good bloat, getting the vampires blood back
    to influence more of them.
</p>
<h2>Considerations</h2>
<p>
    It's nice to see the V5 Tzimisce {{ tzimisce }} finally scoring a win here, and interesting to see {{ ANI }}
    making a comeback. Even though {{ PRO }} has been in fashion lately, and Banu Haqim {{ banu_haqim }} combat
    is very hard to match, {{ ANI }} combat is still a stable and dangerous module.
</p>
<p>
    So, one can wonder: will the Tzimisce {{ tzimisce }} manage to pull off a whole new archetype by themselves,
    or is this kind of Animalism {{ ANI }} mix what we'll see hitting the top tier in a couple of months?
    We'll have to wait and see.
</p>
<p>
    There's not much to say about the deck itself. The Master module is packed already, but maybe there is room for
    a {{ powerbase_los_angeles }} somewhere here. If {{ the_status_perfectus }} is worth including,
    maybe a {{ dog_pack }} deserves consideration too.
</p>
