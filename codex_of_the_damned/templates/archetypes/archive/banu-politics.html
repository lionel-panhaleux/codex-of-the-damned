<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a Banu Haqim {{ banu_haqim }} <em>vote</em> deck using titled vampires,
    with decent combat abilities to make the {{ second_tradition }} effective.
    <em>Bram Von Stappen</em> won the 2023 Dutch NC with this, so it must be good,
    or maybe it's just the player and a good bluff fluke that will be hard to reproduce.
</p>
<p>
    The idea is to influence the highest capacity vampire first, so they can {{ fourth_tradition }} others
    if they get the chance. {{ kasim_bayar }} is the star here, so he's our first choice if available.
    His ability can make use of the vote cards in combat, so, for a vote deck, it's surprisingly dangerous in a fight.
</p>
<p>
    {{ alastor }} is used to fetch {{ helicopter }} and {{ assault_rifle }} at a discount,
    while {{ kine_resources_contested }} and {{ parity_shift }} are used to damage the prey.
    Getting the vote lock might be tricky here, so other voters should be the first targets to take down in combat.
</p>
<h2>Considerations</h2>
<p>
    Should the deck not have a {{ bowl_of_convergence }}? Maybe an {{ anathema }} or two?
    What about {{ alamut }} and {{ the_black_throne }} for additional votes?
    Maybe a second {{ haqims_law_retribution }}?
    Are the {{ ashur_tablets }} really worth it or should they be cut in favor of those Master cards?
</p>
<p>
    More importantly, did this work because it was a susprise and opponents mistakenly supposed it was closer to a
    {{ haqim_royalty }} deck and misplayed against it? Or is it really good in and by itself? Or is it just the player?
    After all, not all of us can match Bram's talent.
</p>
<p>
    All in all it's a very fun variant, making good use of {{ kasim_bayar }}'s ability. Vote decks that are this
    capable in combat are a rarity so they can be challenging to handle for the opponents.
    Maybe it is worth refining and playing more.
