<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>toolbox</em> deck using {{ deep_song }} to rush
    or bleed and a {{ ANI }} block and combat module.
</p>
<p>
    Using {{ nana_buruku }} allows the inclusion of more master cards, in this case
    a stupendous number of {{ anarch_revolt }}. Using {{ deep_song }} to rush, the deck
    can remove any Anarch vampire on the prey's board to let the masters finish them off.
    The incidental {{ fame }} can help in the same regard.
</p>
<p>
    {{ deep_song }}'s versatility is at the core of this deck, as often in {{ ANI }}
    decks. It can be used to bleed or to rush a cumbersome minion depending on the
    situation. The deck has a bit of defense too, focused here on maximising the number
    of wakes and unlock, relying solely on {{ cats_guidance }} for the occasional intercept.
    If needed, {{ villein }} and {{ vessel }} can provide a bit of bloat, and a lucky
    {{ taste_of_vitae }} can be used to resplenish blood on the vampires.
</p>
<p>
    The combat module relies on the usual {{ aid_from_bats }} & {{ carrion_crows }}
    long range Animalism {{ ANI }} module, with a couple of {{ canine_horde }} against weapons
    like {{ magnum }}, and the occasional {{ hell_for_leather }} for a dodge when things
    get too hairy. Finally, {{ terror_frenzy }} is used to be able to keep the range to
    long in face of opposing maneuvers.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ libertas }} is doubled because it counters Presence {{ pre }} combat ends like
    {{ majesty }}. It can come in handy if you stumble on this widespread defense.
</p>
<p>
    Nowadays, {{ voracious_vermin }} might be prefered over {{ canine_horde }},
    since it can still be useful even if there's no weapon.
</p>
<p>
    Without {{ bounces }}, the deck defense is pretty low, so it might need to rush
    back a bit. {{ archon_investigation }} is also almost mandatory here,
    and could be doubled if heavy bleeds are to be expected.
</p>
<p>
    Getting {{ wider_view }} at some point helps getting rid
    of the spurious {{ nana_buruku }} in crypt.
    She's also only played in 3 copies to avoid jamming the crypt too much;
    other minions are needed for the deck to work well.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    The main variant of this archetype was to include 6 to 9 {{ ashur_tablets }} in the
    master module to help fix the card flow and get a bit of additional bloat.
    Check out {{ ed_goncalves_deck }} for an example.
</p>
<p>
    A more toolboxy version is also possible, using more intercept with cards like
    {{ the_anarch_free_press }} and {{ raven_spy }}, to increase the defense and protect
    permanents like {{ army_of_rats }} or {{ powerbase_montreal }}.
    {{ codex_of_the_edenic_groundskeepers }} might also fit here, to help with the oust.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Weenie ANI</strong> variant plays Animalism {{ ANI }} without {{ nana_buruku }}.
    It is arguably less versatile, and more of a rush deck than a toolbox deck, but it's still very strong.
    {{ kim_nilsson_s_deck }} from the 2016 Swedish NC is a good example.
