<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a Lasombra {{ lasombra }} <em>bleed & vote</em> deck starring {{ bruce_de_guy }}.
    The strategy is not so far off from what a {{ stanislava }} deck would be doing, hence the name.
    <em>Martin Weinmeyer</em> has been leading the competitive ladder multiple years in a row
    with his <em>Reign of Stanislava</em> deck, which was later printed as the {{ anniversary }} precon.
    And this archetype was originally his idea.
</p>
<p>
    The plan is to get {{ bruce_de_guy }} out, or the highest capacity vampire from the crypt
    if he's not there, then use {{ govern_the_unaligned }} at superior Dominate {{ DOM }} to influence a couple
    of helpers cheap and fast. Then, bleed and vote to oust preys successively, using Obtenebration {{ OBT }}
    modifiers for stealth, and a few {{ freak_drive }} to get more actions.
</p>
<p>
    On the defense side, a single unlocked high capacity vampire can hold the fort by blocking and spamming
    {{ obedience }}, while also simply using {{ deflection }} against stealthed bleeds.
    {{ under_siege }} and {{ eternal_vigilance }} can be used to get the necessary unlocks and intercept.
</p>
<p>
    The Master module provides bloat with {{ villein }} and blood regeneration
    for the vampires to feed the Dominate {{ DOM }} cost, as well as a bit of stealth. To help with the card flow,
    and avoid jamming on stealth if the opponents decide not to block, {{ dreams_of_the_sphinx }}.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    The deck is tailored to handle both high stealth bleed predators like {{ platinum_revelation }} or {{ malk_22 }},
    but also bruise & bleed builds like {{ haqim_royalty }} or {{ brujah_resistance }}. It might struggle to get the
    vote lock against dedicated vote decks, but in this case, it can simply fall back on bleeding.
</p>
<p>
    {{ enkil_cog }} is, of course, desirable. Especially because one can use it to bleed
    during the prey's turn, which will completely negate the possibility of an
    {{ archon_investigation }}: since it's an out-of-turn Master, it cannot be played
    by the prey during their own turn. But it can also be used to bleed at the end of one's predator turn,
    to get the Edge and benefit from it immediately.
</p>
<p>
    {{ banishment }} is a key lunge device for this deck. It can be used to remove a troublesome blocker or a potential
    bouncer, as well as a key voter if there's a window for it. Drwan early, it can simply put off the prey or predator
    tempo, depending on what seems most beneficial.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    This is an iteration over a prior {{ decklist_from_martin_weinmeyer }}, with only a few additions.
</p>
<p>
    There is a <strong>Group 2-3</strong> variant with {{ montano }} and {{ ambrosio }},
    see {{ gabriel_carnino_s_deck }} for an example.
    Getting a bit of Presence {{ PRE }} to be able to play {{ voter_captivation }} is very endearing,
    and {{ montano }}'s ability is very strong.
    But {{ bruce_de_guy }}'s ability, to get the vote lock, is hard to match.
