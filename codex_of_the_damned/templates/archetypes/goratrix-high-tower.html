<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>wall</em> deck starring {{ goratrix }}.
    Its superior {{ ANI }} allows him to use
    {{ sense_the_savage_way }}, a powerful
    addition to the {{ AUS }} intercept module.
</p>
<p>
    {{ goratrix }} combat ability is very good: as
    {{ theft_of_vitae }}, its damage can not be prevented.
    The use of {{ carrion_crows }} for additional damage and
    {{ canine_horde }} against weapons makes for a powerful
    but slim combat module.
</p>
<p>
    {{ magic_of_the_smith }} is used to fetch powerful
    equipments adapted to the table context.
    {{ heart_of_nizchetus }} is always good,
    {{ bowl_of_convergence }} adds additional intercept,
    {{ ivory_bow }},
    {{ kevlar_vest }} and
    {{ ruins_of_ceoris }} are great additions for combat.
</p>
<p>
    The intercept module is very heavy, with 20 wakes not counting the
    {{ cats_guidance }}, 9 bleed bounces to help deliver
    pool damage to the prey, and a total of 45 bonus intercept available accross 45 reaction cards.
</p>
<p>
    Pool damage is done using
    {{ anarch_revolt }},
    {{ army_of_rats }} and
    {{ smiling_jack_the_anarch }}, with the addition of
    {{ enkil_cog }} at some point to have
    {{ goratrix }} bleed for 3 at the end of its predator's turn
    if he is still unlocked.
</p>
<p>
    {{ anarch_revolt }} is ineffective if the prey gets
    <em>Anarch</em> vampires into play, but {{ eagle_s_sight }}
    can be used to intercept these <em>Anarchs</em> whatever they do and dispose of them quickly.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    The sidekicks in the crypt also have the {{ AUS }}{{ ANI }} disciplines combination
    to help with intercept in case a {{ pentex_subversion }} is played.
</p>
<p>
    {{ rutor_s_hand }} and {{ mylan_horseed }} are used to enable
    {{ goratrix }} to act and still stay unlocked.
</p>
<p>
    {{ villein }} and {{ vessel }} are used to bloat a bit from
    {{ goratrix }}, as its combat ability should ensure he never runs out of blood.
</p>
<p>
    Given the disciplines span available to {{ goratrix }},
    {{ the_erciyes_fragments }} becomes very versatile.
    It can provide additional wakes and bounces but also bleed enhancers.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    There are not many variants in this archetype.
    {{ read_the_winds }} is often included in the intercept module,
    and surprise aggravated damage from {{ vic }} can be added, like
    {{ breath_of_the_dragon }} or {{ chiropteran_marauder }}.
</p>
<p>
    It is possible to build a non-anarch version of this archetype. It looses the damages from
    {{ anarch_revolt }}, but gains access to {{ abbot }} and {{ powerbase_barranquilla }},
    like in {{ jakub_baranowski_s_deck }} from the 2013 Polish NC.
