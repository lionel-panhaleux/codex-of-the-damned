<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a breed and boon deck starring {{ anson }} and using {{ pre }} as the
	discipline to push votes. The purpose is to have him out as fast as possible
	to use {{ politics }} to oust the prey.
</p>

<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    Using {{ grooming }} cost quite an amount of blood and it is necessary to
	replenish vampires from time to time. {{ voter_cap }} can be used to do this
	instead of hunting as much as possible. This solution does not cost more actions
	and it will be easier to maximise damage done to the prey.
</p>
<p>
    {{ krc }} is the best action to deal massive damage. It is possible to
	negociate with the great predator how to assign damage if their votes are necessary.
	It is important to still deal more damage to the prey than to the predator because it
	will only help the great predator do their point and become the predator more quickly
	
</p>
<p>
    {{ parity_shift }} can only be called by Princes, namely  {{ anson }}
	and {{ tatiana }}. Always having at least one of them ready to call for
	 {{ parity_shift }} is the only way to {{ bloat }} without
	 {{ grooming }} and {{ toreador_justicar }} is the only way to have more 
	 vampires  able to call for this vote.
</p>
<p>
    It is a good idea when the grand-prey deck has good block capacity to 
    deal some damage to them because they do 
	not get the chance to block the undirected vote actions until they are
	either the prey or the predator.
</p>
<p>
	{{ tgb }} is of great help against prey and/or predator with a good block capability
	as a low capacity vampire can be chosen to make all votes from
	{{ anson }} unblockable. This same low cap vampire can be chosen to
	make all votes from another vampire unblockable with anoter {{ tgb }}.
</p>

<h2>Suggested changes</h2>
<p>
    This deck contains cards that are banned
	({{ anthelios }} and {{ temptation }})
	and cards that have been errata'ed ({{ pentex_subversion }}
	and {{ parity_shift }}).
	As detailed hereunder, {{ parity_shift }} is still good but the other cards
	need to be replaced.
</p>
<p>
    My suggestions are one {{ elder_library }} and one extra {{krc}}.
	The {{elder_library }} will help you have more cards in hand. The purpose is
	to have a bigger and less jam-able hand. This Master card is not used often
	and it will help you not to contest it to keep your pool to swarm.
</p>

<h2>Tournament Version</h2>
<p>
    {{ inaki_jimenez_deck }} is the only tournament version of this deck.
