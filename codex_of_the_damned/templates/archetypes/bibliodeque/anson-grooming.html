<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a breed and boon deck starring {{ anson }} and uses  {{ pre }} as the
	discipline to push votes. The purpose is to have him out as fast as possible
	to use {{ politics }} to kill your prey.
</p>

<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    Using {{ grooming }} cost quite an amount of blood and it is necessary to
	replenish your vampire from time to time. Use {{ voter_cap }} to do this
	instead of hunting as much as you can. This way you won't lose any action
	and it will be easier to maximise the damages you can deal to your prey.
</p>
<p>
    {{ krc }} is the best action to deal massive damages. It is possible to
	negiciate with your great predator how to assign the damages. Do not forget
	that you still have to kill your prey and dealing too much damages to your
	predator will only help your great predator do their point and come after
	you more quickly.
</p>
<p>
    {{ parity_shift }} can only be called by Princes in this deck :  {{ anson }}
	and {{ tatiana }}. Be sure to always have one of them available to call for
	 {{ parity_shift }} as it is the only way to {{ bloat }} without
	 {{ grooming }}. {{ toreador_justicar }} is the only way to have more
	 vampires able to call for a {{ parity_shift }}.
</p>
<p>
    It is a good idea when the grand-prey deck has good block capacity: they do
	not get the chance to block the undirected vote actions until they are
	either the prey or the predator. {{ tgb }} is of great help against this
	kind of deck as a low capacity vampire can be chosen to make all votes from
	{{ anson }} unblockable.
</p>

<h2>Suggested changes</h2>
<p>
    This deck contains cards that are banned
	({{ anthelios }} and {{ temptation }})
	and cards that have been errata'ed ({{ pentex_subversion }}
	and {{ parity_shift }}).
	As detailed hereunder, {{ parity_shift }} is still good but the other cards
	need to be replaced.
</p>
<p>
    My suggestions are one {{ elder_library }} and one extra {{krc}}.
	The {{elder_library }} will help you have more cards in hand. The purpose is
	to have a bigger and less jam-able hand. This Master card is not used often
	and it will help you not to contest it to keep your pool to swarm.
</p>

<h2>Tournament Version</h2>
<p>
    {{ inaki_jimenez_deck }} is the only tournament version of this deck.
