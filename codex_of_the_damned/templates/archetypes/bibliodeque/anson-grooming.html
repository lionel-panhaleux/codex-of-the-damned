<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
	This is a <em>breed & boon</em> deck starring {{ anson }} and using {{ PRE }} as the
	discipline to push votes. The purpose is to have him out as fast as possible
	to use {{ politics }} to oust the prey.
</p>

<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
	Using {{ grooming }} cost quite an amount of blood and it is necessary to
	replenish vampires from time to time. {{ voter_cap }} can be used to do this
	instead of hunting as much as possible. This solution does not cost more actions
	and it will be easier to maximise damage done to the prey.
</p>
<p>
	{{ krc }} is the best action to deal massive damage. It is possible to
	negociate with the great predator how to assign damage if their votes are necessary.
	It is important to still deal more damage to the prey than to the predator. Otherwise, it
	will only help the great predator oust their prey and become the predator more quickly.
</p>
<p>
	It is a good idea when the grand-prey deck has good block capacity to also
	deal some damage to them because they do not get the chance to block the
	undirected vote actions until they are either the prey or the predator.
</p>
<p>
	{{ parity_shift }} can only be called by Princes, namely  {{ anson }}
	and {{ tatiana }}. Always having at least one of them ready to call for
	it is the only way to {{ bloat }} without {{ grooming }}.
	{{ toreador_justicar }} is the only way to have more vampires able to call
	for this vote.
</p>
<p>
	{{ tgb }} is of great help against prey and/or predator with a good block
	capability as a low capacity vampire can be chosen to make all votes from
	{{ anson }} unblockable. This same low cap vampire can be chosen to
	make all votes from another vampire unblockable with anoter {{ tgb }}.
</p>

<h2>Tournament Version</h2>
<p>
    {{ inaki_jimenez_deck }} is the only tournament version of this deck.
