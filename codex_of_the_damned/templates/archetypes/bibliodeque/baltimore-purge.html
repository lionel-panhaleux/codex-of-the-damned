<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>special</em> deck using {{ montano }} to play {{ baltimore_purge }},
    then {{ freak_drive }} to get out of torpor and play {{ graverobbing }}
    to permanently steal opponents vampires.
    {{ mind_rape }} is added to the mix for additional vampire thefts.
    {{ heidelberg_castle_germany }} is used to take the blood of stolen vampires
    and give it to {{ montano }}, fueling the costly combination.
</p>
<p>
    It is a dreadful combination and, therefore, quickly attracts the table attention.
    This archetype is seldom played and has not yet won any major tournament.
</p>
<p>
    The deck packs quite a lot of {{ obt }} stealth considering
    {{ montano }} already has an included stealth bonus:
    indeed, getting blocked somewhere suring the combo can be deadly,
    so the deck has to make sure it does not happen.
</p>
<p>
    The entire combat module is defensive, using
    {{ shadow_body }} and {{ obedience }}.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ zillahs_valley }}, {{ dreams_of_the_sphinx }} and
    {{ information_highway }} are used to get {{ montano }} out faster.
</p>
<p>
    {{ enkil_cog }} lets {{ montano }} bleed for 3 and act during the other players turns.
    Playing a {{ baltimore_purge }} during the predator's turn
    makes the whole combination easier.
</p>
<p>
    {{ renewed_vigor }} is used at inferior {{ for }} to help get {{ montano }}
    out of torpor when he plays {{ baltimore_purge }}.
</p>
<p>
    {{ eluding_the_arms_of_morpheus }} provides additional unlock:
    it can be used to unlock during an opponent's turn and,
    if {{ enkil_cog }} is into play and the block does not happen,
    a new action can be performed at the end of the opponent's turn.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    There are only minor variations to this archetype.
    {{ govern_the_unaligned }} and {{ perfectionist }} are often included.
