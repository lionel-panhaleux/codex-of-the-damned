<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>special</em> deck using {{ madness_network }}
    and {{ reversal_of_fortunes }}.
</p>
<p>
    The idea is to get some low capacity Malkavians out fast together with a
    {{ madness_network }}, then play {{ reversal_of_fortunes }}
    during the prey's turn to play again, then again on the predator's turn to play again, etc.
    playing twice as much as the opponents.
</p>
<p>
    The first vampires get a bit locked in the combination, and the rest of the deck focuses on playing a lot
    of Master cards, {{ brainwash }} and {{ kaymakli_nightmares }} to prevent the opponents
    of even getting a vampire out.
</p>
<p>
    The deck then kills with simple bleeds and {{ smiling_jack_the_anarch }}.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    Rotation is tricky in this deck, and
    {{ dreams_of_the_sphinx }}, {{ specialization }} and {{ heart_of_nizchetus }}
    all help in this regard.
</p>
<p>
    Although {{ victor_pelletier }} is not a Malkavian,
    his ability is priceless in this deck, as {{ reversal_of_fortunes }}
    needs some votes to get through.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    There are not many variants of this deck.
    {{ orian_gissler_s_deck }} from 2009 was the original attempt.
