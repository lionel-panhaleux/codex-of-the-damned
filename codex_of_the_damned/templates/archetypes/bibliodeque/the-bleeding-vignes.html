<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>powerbleed</em> deck using {{ edward_vignes }}
    and low capacity vampires with the {{ dom }}{{ pre }} disciplines.
    {{ edward_vignes }} ability to counter rush actions with a discard
    is an excellent protection against combat-oriented decks.
</p>
<p>
    {{ bonding }} and {{ seduction }} are used to get the bleed through.
    {{ anarch_troublemaker }}, {{ misdirection }} and {{ pentex_subversion }}
    are used to lock the prey vampires, together with the {{ PRE }} combination
    {{ mind_numb }} + {{ majesty }}.
</p>
<p>
    {{ deflection }} and {{ delaying_tactics }} are used for defence.
</p>
<p>
    Getting some blood back on {{ edward_vignes }} is critical,
    as many cards he uses have a blood cost,
    so {{ the_coven }}, {{ giant_s_blood }} and {{ jake_washington }} are included.
    Even {{ blood_doll }} can be used to move blood from the pool.
    In this example, {{ life_in_the_city }} is added
    to get even more blood back on the table.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    The name of the archetype is a wordplay referring to {{ bleeding_the_vine }}.
</p>
<p>
    {{ daring_the_dawn }} and {{ foreshadowing_destruction }} are used for the lunge.
    The use of {{ direct_intervention }} on a modifier
    like {{ conditioning }} prevents it to be played again on the
    same action (as a modifier can only be played once and, even if countered).
    Using an alternative bleed enhancer is permitted though
    (the modifier did not apply, so limited bleed enhancement is still possible).
    {{ foreshadowing_destruction }} can even save a lunge this way.
</p>
<p>
    The deck is expected to be very aggressive toward its prey
    and get a quick victory point in the game beginning,
    so {{ the_bitter_and_sweet_story }} makes sense
    as it will help keeping some momentum afterwards.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    There are not many variations to this archetype.
    {{ life_in_the_city }} is an original inclusion,
    {{ entrancement }} and {{ force_of_personality }} are often included.
