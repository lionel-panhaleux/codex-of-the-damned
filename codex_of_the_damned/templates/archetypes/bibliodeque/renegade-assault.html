<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>rush</em> deck using {{ renegade_garou }}
    and low capacity {{ pro }} vampires to take down other minions around the table.
    {{ tribute_to_the_master }} is used to bloat and
    naked bleed actions are used to deliver pool damage to the prey.
</p>
<p>
    The combat module is strong and heavy, and {{ target_vitals }} and
    {{ weighted_walking_stick }} can be used indistinctively by vampires or werewolves.
    {{ fame }} is used for additional pool damage on the prey.
<p>
    If {{ jacob_fermor }} gets into play, werewolves
    see their bleed boosted, which can be nice for the lunge.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ the_unmasking }} transform the werewolves into
    good blockers, which is always nice defensively.
</p>
<p>
    {{ poison_pill }} is an alternative to {{ delaying_tactics }}:
    it costs less blood and can disable a damage dealing vote like {{ reins_of_power }}.
</p>
<p>
    {{ direct_intervention }} is a very effective counter
    against anti-ally actions like {{ entrancement }}.
</p>
<p>
    {{ earth_meld }} is an effective combat defence to protect
    the low capacity vampires.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    The main variant includes more copies of {{ jacob_fermor }} and {{ renegade_garou }}
    to make the most of the core combination of the deck.
    {{ antti_tirila_s_deck }} from 2009 is a good example.
    It also includes {{ dragonbound }} and {{ camera_phone }} to enhance pool damage.
