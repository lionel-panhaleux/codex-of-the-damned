<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
	This is a leeching deck using {{ VAL }} to disrupt the bleeds of one's prey.
	The objective is to reduce the pool of one's prey to 0 using {{ operation }}
	and preventing it to gain the edge using {{ hidetheheart }}.
</p>
<p>
	The deck uses low to mid capacity vampires to get the two cards above running as
	quickly as possible. The rest of the deck is protection against situations
	that may arise when trying to deal with the prey.
</p>

<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
	An OseboÂ {{ osebo }} vampire should get out first to start putting some
	{{ operation }} into play and then a vampire with {{ VAL }} is in order to start
	disrupting the prey's bleeds.
</p>
<p>
	As the game progresses and the number of {{ operation }} in play grows,
	the lunge is at reach but the timing is critical: killing the prey means they will
	be some blood on the {{ operation }} cards and, if the grand-prey can get edge,
	they can get some of this blood back.
</p>
<h2>Tournament Version</h2>
<p>
	This deck is a variant from {{ kovalcik_deck }} from 2014.
