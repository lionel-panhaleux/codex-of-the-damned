<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a leeching deck using {{ VAL }} to disrupt the bleeds of one's prey.
	The objective is to reduce the pool of one's prey to 0 using {{ operation }}
	and preventing it to gain the edge using {{ hidetheheart }}.
</p>
<p>
    The deck uses low to mid capacity vampires get the two cards above running as quickly
	as possible. The rest of the deck is protection against situations that may arise
	when trying to deal with the prey.
</p>

<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    Try to get an <em>Osebo</em> vampire first to start putting some {{ operation }}
	into play and then aim to get a {{ VAL }} vampire and starting to disrupt your
	prey's bleeds.
</p>
<p>
    As the game progresses, you might have more than five {{ operation }} in play
	and you'll be nearing killing your prey but be sure that your great-prey does
	not have the Edge the moment you'll be doing your point because they will be
	able to get some of your prey's pool by burning the Edge.
</p>
<h2>Tournament Version</h2>
<p>
    This deck is a variant from {{ kovalcik_deck }} from 2014.
