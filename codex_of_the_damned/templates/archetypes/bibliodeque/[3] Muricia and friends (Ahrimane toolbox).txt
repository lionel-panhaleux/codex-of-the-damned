Deck Name: Bibliodèque [3] Muricia and friends (Ahrimane toolbox)
Author: Yohann Guyader (TWD of French championship 2013)
Description:
The Bibliodèque is a French project made of 99 decklists (and designed to welcome more in the future hopefully) based on Tournament winning Decklists or Archetypes, to help people building decks for their casual play or tournaments, and ultimately print those decks in proxy to have a library of decks available for their playgroup.

Much thanks for the French people helping in various ways: Ezra, Tim, Cordovader, Darkal, Stone and so on... and to the players which decks have served as basis for the decks presented (or were shamelessly copied directly) 

You may find the complete historic of the project at

and the google drive to the final Bibliodèque will be the following
