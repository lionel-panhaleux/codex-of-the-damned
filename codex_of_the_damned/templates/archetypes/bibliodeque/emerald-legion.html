<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is an <em>allies toolbox</em> deck using {{ emerald_legionnaire }}.
    This version uses {{ erlik }} as a star: his ability lets the player get
    another Harbinger {{ harbinger_of_skulls }} out fast and cheap.
</p>
<p>
    The idea is to defend and get an {{ emerald_legionnaire }} out,
    then bring the others back from the ash heap if they are there.
    Once {{ the_unmasking }} and {{ fbi_special_affairs_division }} hit the table,
    they're a solid defence.
</p>
<p>
    {{ liquidation }} is used to bloat and can put some {{ emerald_legionnaire }},
    but also the cards to power their ability, in the ash heap.
</p>
<p>
    As the game progresses, {{ emerald_legionnaire }} are used to bleed: they bleed only
    for one each, which negates the defensive power of {{ bounces }}, but they quickly
    swarm up, especially since they're not that easy to kill and they can be dreadful
    in combat with {{ target_vitals }}. On top of it,
    {{ vengeful_spirit }} and {{ trochomancy }} help boost the Harbinger bleeds, too.
</p>
<p>
    The deck uses combat defense for the Harbingers {{ harbinger_of_skulls }},
    with {{ for }} prevention cards like {{ rolling_with_the_punches }} alongside
    simple combat ends like {{ spiritual_intervention }}, {{ delaying_tactics }} for
    vote defense and {{ AUS }} bounces like {{ telepathic_misdirection }} against bleeds.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    To be able to use their ability, an {{ emerald_legionnaire }} must be put into play
    by recruiting it: the ones in the ash heap can not have their effect used —
    their card text is ignored as long as they are in the ash heap.
    In order to manage to get at least one into play, the deck packs a bit of
    stealth with {{ spectral_divination }}, {{ call_of_the_hungry_dead }} and
    {{ breath_of_thanatos }}.
</p>
<p>
    A key feature of this deck is the versatility of its cards:
    {{ spectral_divination }} can be used for stealth or intercept,
    {{ breath_of_thanatos }} for stealth or a deadly strike, and so on.
</p>
<p>
    Many cards in the deck allow for additional discards to feed the
    {{ emerald_legionnaire }}'s ability. {{ liquidation }}, of course, but also
    {{ the_barrens }}, {{ dreams_of_the_sphinx }}, {{ aura_reading }} and
    {{ babalawo_alafin }}.
</p>
<p>
    {{ trochomancy }} is a very {{ meta }} dependant inclusion,
    as {{ inevitability_of_the_void }} can be a stronger alternative to lunge. 
    But {{ trochomancy }} has the distinct advantage to be a very strong counter against
    other {{ emerald_legionnaire }} decks as well as recursion heavy builds relying on
    {{ ashur_tablets }}.
</p>
<p>
    The archetype has been so successful the last few years that a lot of decks now
    include strong counters against ally swarms, specifically ally-stealing actions
    like {{ entrancement }} and {{ far_majesty }} as well as anti-swarm votes like
    {{ anarchist_uprising }} and {{ ancilla_empowerment }}. The hight number of
    {{ direct_intervention }} and {{ delaying_tactics }} in the deck is designed
    to counterbalance this trend.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    With {{ erlik }} as a star, {{ forced_march }} is often included.
    A few equipments like {{ sniper_rifle }}, {{ erebus_mask }} and
    {{ heart_of_nizchetus }} are also common. 
</p>
<p>
    A variant uses {{ the_capuchin }} as star, {{ richard_stefan_utners_deck }}
    from 2019 is a good example of it.
</p>
<p>
    Another successful variant is {{ anttis_kurshidwall }}, using {{ khurshid }} as a
    star and introducing a small Anarch module with {{ anarch_convert }}, to allow for
    the inclusion of {{ piper }} for safe recruitments, and {{ gear_up }} for a welcome
    bit of recursion that plays very well with {{ liquidation }}.
    It's also possible to use {{ khurshid }} without going for the Anarch angle, like
    {{ lukasz_ho_thanh_proved }} through multiple wins.
</p>
<p>
    {{ emerald_legionnaire }}'s ability is so self-sufficient that one does not even
    need to play a full Harbingers {{ harbinger_of_skulls }} crypt to make them work.
    Bill Troxel has been industrious in using them in very convoulted builds, like
    his {{ world_championships_win }} using {{ tupdog }} and {{ agent_of_power }}
    to play {{ summon_history }} to fetch them, or his {{ daughters_of_cacophony }}
    and {{ imbued }} variants. Other big names have explored alternatives, most notably
    {{ oriols_giotto }} and {{ daniels_weenie_obfuscate }}.
