Deck Name: Bibliodèque [8] Cybele maleficia (Baali tap n'bleed)
Author: Antoine Franqueville-Roy
Description:
The Bibliodèque is a French project made of 99 decklists (and designed to welcome more in the future hopefully) based on Tournament winning Decklists or Archetypes, to help people building decks for their casual play or tournaments, and ultimately print those decks in proxy to have a library of decks available for their playgroup.

Much thanks for the French people helping in various ways: Ezra, Tim, Cordovader, Darkal, Stone and so on... and to the players which decks have served as basis for the decks presented (or were shamelessly copied directly)

and the google drive to the final Bibliodèque will be the following
