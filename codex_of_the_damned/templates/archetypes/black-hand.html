<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>stealth & bleed</em> deck using {{ reunion_kamut }} and
    {{ recruitment_exercise }} to get more vampires out fast and cheap.
    Bleed is enhanced by permanent modifier like {{ camera_phone }}, with {{ obf }}
    modifiers for stealth.
</p>
<p>
    Black Hand Seraphs have acces to the {{ a_b }} enhancers {{ tattoo_signal }}
    and {{ watchtower_four_ride_forth }}: this is the key of the deck. Many Black Hand
    vampires have {{ obf }} to provide enough stealth to get most actions through,
    bleeds or bloat alike.
</p>
<p>
    A carefully chosen crypt provides a stable enough access to {{ AUS }} to
    include bleed defence in the form of bounces with {{ telepathic_misdirection }}
    and {{ my_enemy_s_enemy }}.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    The {{ tattoo_signal }} and {{ reunion_kamut }} combination is the core of the deck.
    Once a Seraph is out, a Black Hand sidekick quickly follows and can continue
    to use {{ reunion_kamut }} repetitively to get more minions out. Getting the blood
    back in pool is also an option, providing a solid bloat if needed.
</p>
<p>
    {{ delaying_tactics }} should be kept to counter {{ anarchist_uprising }} or similar
    votes, as they could end this deck once enough minions are out.
</p>
<p>
    The deck does not have much in terms of combat defence, but low capacity sidekicks
    can always stay around to block any threatening action against their Seraph.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    This archetype is probably the most variable in the top tier. The bloat mechanic
    based on {{ tattoo_signal }} and {{ reunion_kamut }} is a constant, as well
    as the high stealth from {{ obf }}. Depending on the crypt, both {{ dom }} and
    {{ AUS }} are viable options for bounces, with {{ watchtower_four_ride_forth }}
    for additional unlock. From the combat module to carefully handpicked additions,
    the rest varies a lot from one deck to the next.
</p>
<p>
    A full fledged Banu Haqim version is also possible, as in {{ rauls_deck }}.
    {{ QUI }} provies more tricks and a stronger bleed, but {{ AUS }} has to be dropped
    and the bleed defence gets that much weaker.
</p>
<p>
    Another variation uses a mid capacity multi-clan crypt with {{ dom }}.
    It looses the {{ obf }} stealth but can be more toolboxy with more intercept thanks
    to {{ ministry_card }} and {{ abbot }}, provided the combat module packs a bit more
    punch. {{ mark_loughmans_deck }} from 2018 is a recent example.
</p>
<p>
    {{ elimelech_the_twice_damned }} can be even more of a star in order to include a
    few {{ DEM }} cards, especially {{ kindred_spirits }}, as in {{ fernandos_deck }}
    from 2018.
