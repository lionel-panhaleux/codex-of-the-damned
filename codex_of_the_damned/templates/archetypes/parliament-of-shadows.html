<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>vote & bleed</em> deck relying on the Lasombra {{ lasombra }} clan
    and their titled Sabbat vampires. The archetype nowadays takes its name from the
    {{ sabbat_precon }} distributed by BCP, based on this idea.
</p>
<p>
    As usual with {{ DOM }} decks, the plan is to get the highest capacity vampire out
    first, so that he can use {{ govern_the_unaligned }} at superior {{ DOM }} to
    get more vampires out fast and cheap. Relying on big capacity vampires in his crypt,
    the deck also uses the classic {{ zillah_s_valley }} + {{ villein }} combination
    to influence faster in the beginning.
</p>
<p>
    Given the number of big capacity vampires, the deck naturally includes all three
    "big capacity" votes: {{ ancient_influence }}, {{ reins_of_power }} and 
    {{ political_stranglehold }}. It also tends to include multiple {{ banishment }}
    and quite a few votes devestating to swarms like {{ anarchist_uprising }} and 
    {{ domain_challenge }}.
</p>
<p>
    On the bleed side, {{ DOM }} brings its usual package with {{ govern_the_unaligned }}
    but also {{ foreshadowing_destruction }} and {{ seduction }}. Stealth is provided
    by {{ OBT }} and its numerous modifiers, but also by {{ montano }}'s ability.
</p>
<p>
    There is a bit of bleed defense with {{ deflection }}, and combat defence is assured
    by both {{ combat_ends }} with {{ shadow_body }} and the excellent {{ obedience }},
    a sure way of getting out of trouble, provided it can be played.
</p>
<p>
    Given the crypt here, the deck has unusual access to both {{ for }} and {{ PRE }},
    which allows for the inclusion of {{ freak_drive }} for multi-action (vote and 
    bleed in the same turn with a single vampire) and {{ voter_captivation }} to help
    regenerate blood when a vote goes well.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    The deck does not include any wake, so it is important to keep an eye out for
    threats and keep a vampire unlocked if necessary: {{ obedience }} and
    {{ deflection }} can only be played by unlocked vampires. In case those reactions
    are in hand and could come in handy, playing it slow and keep a non-acting vampire
    for defence is the way to go here. Luckily, between {{ freak_drive }} and
    {{ moncada }}'s ability, this should not be too much of a burden.
</p>
<p>
    The deck is well equipped for crypt acceleration: between {{ zillah_s_valley }},
    {{ information_highway }} and {{ dreams_of_the_sphinx }}, it has 9 cards that will
    gain a turn of influence to get Montano out (or the other oldest vampire) if
    drawn in first hand, which has a 64% chance of occurence: this is probably the
    minimal advisable density here so it should be kept in mind when tweaking
    the deck: if the library cards count get up, a couple of {{ zillah_s_valley }}
    should be added to keep the proportions. Likewise, if removing one or the other
    of these three cards, the other two should be augmented accordingly.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    There is a lot of space for tweaks and variations here: the Master module can help
    getting the vote lock in multiple ways, with {{ power_structure }},
    {{ powerbase_madrid }} and {{ dia_de_los_muertos }} for example, but also
    {{ fear_of_mekhet }} against Inner Circle decks if you expect some.
    {{ monastery_of_shadows }} is a common inclusion, as well as {{ mylan_horseed }}.
    Include a couple {{ on_the_qui_vive }} or {{ nocturn }} is also usual,
    and the combat module, given the access to {{ POT }} and the nice tricks {{ OBT }}
    has to offer can often pack a couple of surprises like {{ entombment }}, {{ slam }}
    or {{ disarm }} just to get the opponents to hesitate before entering combat.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Vitel</strong> variant uses {{ marcus_vitel }} as a star, his Prince
    title allowing for the inclusion of {{ parity_shift }}, like in {{ tuomas_deck }}
    from 2019. It also tends to have more stable access to {{ PRE }}, so a 
    few vote modifiers like {{ bewitching_oration }} are a good inclusion.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Beast</strong> variant packs a bit more combat and intercept to
    transform this deck in a toolbox of sorts. In a light combat environment, he can
    have devastating effects, and the few {{ POT }} cards that are included serve as
    a useful deterrent against combat for the titled vampires, who all have access to
    the discipline. {{ petrus_deck }} from 2017 is a good example.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, the <strong>G5</strong> approach relies on the new vampires published
    in the {{ sabbat_precon }} to build a diffferent crypt with groups 5 and 6, like
    in {{ tuomas_deck_2 }} from 2019.
