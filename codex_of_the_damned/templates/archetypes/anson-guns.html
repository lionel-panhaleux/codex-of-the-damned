<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>toolbox</em> deck starring {{ anson }} and using {{ magnum }},
    hence the name.
</p>
<p>
    {{ anson }} should be influenced first, followed by one or more sidekicks depending
    on the crypt and the overall table situation.
</p>
<p>
    The deck is uses {{ haven_uncovered }} and {{ bums_rush }} to rush,
    {{ second_tradition_domain }} for wake and intercept and
    {{ concealed_weapon }} + {{ magnum }} with {{ CEL }} for combat.
    {{ parity_shift }} can deliver a bit of pool damage and {{ anson }}'s ability
    is used to bloat and use recursion with {{ ashur_tablets }}.
</p>
<p>
    This version is definitely leaning on the rush side of the build — the payload is
    reduced to simple bleeds of 1 and a few pool-damage cards linked to combats like
    {{ tension_in_the_ranks }}, {{ fame }} and {{ dragonbound }}.
</p>
<p>
    The combat module relies a lot on the synergy between {{ infernal_pursuit }} and
    {{ ashur_tablets }}: the first lets you scan through your deck quickly to get the
    hand you need, while the second let you take back the useful cards in the ash heap
    and shape your deck depending on the table situation.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ the_erciyes_fragments }} and {{ powerbase_montreal }} are good tools that can be
    protected using {{ second_tradition_domain }}. It's useful to get at least a second
    Prince or Justicar out so enough vampires can play it.
</p>
<p>
    One should not hesitate to enter combat with just an {{ infernal_pursuit }} in hand:
    given the number of combat cards and their versatility, the deck is design to play
    a few of them - even to no effect, just to cycle cards and get a hold of the
    {{ concealed_weapon }} + {{ magnum }} combination fast.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    The <strong>AAA</strong> variant uses more Toreador {{ toreador }} companions for 
    {{ anson }}, especially {{ alexandra }} and {{ anneke }}, hence the name.
    {{ enricos_deck }} from 2019 is a good example.
</p>
<p>
    The deck offers a lot of tinkering possibilities. While this version is focused on
    combat, you can definitely give it more of a toolbox feeling by changing a few cards
    around, like in {{ jorge_delgados_deck }} from 2018. {{ resist_earths_grasp }} is
    very versatile, providing stealth or mobility, and a pair of
    {{ kine_resources_contested }} can help with the oust.
    {{ aire_of_elation }} is another possible inclusion here.
