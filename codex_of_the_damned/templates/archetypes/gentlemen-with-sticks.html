<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>toolbox</em> deck using Ventrue <em>Princes</em>.
</p>
<p>
    The idea is to get the highest capacity vampire out,
    then use {{ govern_the_unaligned }} at superior {{ DOM }} to get more vampires out
    fast and cheap, then later to bleed with the help of some {{ dom }} modifiers.
</p>
<p>
    The intercept module is built around the fact the many vampires in the crypt
    are <em>Princes</em> and use {{ second_tradition_domain }} heavily.
    {{ deflection }} is used to bounce bleeds in case they get through anyway.
</p>
<p>
    The combat module uses {{ for }} for damage prevention and
    {{ weighted_walking_stick }} to deal more damage.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ daring_the_dawn }} and {{ foreshadowing_destruction }} are used for the lunge.
    The use of {{ direct_intervention }} on a modifier
    like {{ conditioning }} prevents it to be played again on the
    same action (as a modifier can only be played once, even if countered).
    Using an alternative bleed enhancer is permitted though
    (the modifier did not apply, so limited bleed enhancement is still possible).
    {{ foreshadowing_destruction }} can even save a lunge this way.
</p>
<p>
    {{ scourge_of_the_enochians }} and {{ anarchist_uprising }} are counters against
    breed constructs, as they can become overwhelming for this deck.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    There are many minor variations to this archetype.
    {{ parity_shift }} and {{ entrancement }} are often included,
    {{ seduction }} can help to get the bleed through.
    On the Master side, {{ papillon }} and {{ island_of_yiaros }} are common inclusions.
    Finally, some {{ freak_drive }} to increase {{ a_b }} is often seen too.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Law Firm</strong> variant ditches the combat module
    and replaces it with some {{ majesty }}, with a good number of {{ freak_drive }}
    for multiple actions. With more damaging votes like {{ kine_resources_contested }},
    it makes for many aggressive actions, and they quickly become hard to block.
    {{ anthony_coleman_s_deck }} from the 2009 English NC
    is a good example. It is also often played with a group 1-2 crypt,
    as {{ emerson_bridges }} and {{ sir_walter_nash }} are good Princes for the job,
    at a low cost. {{ sergio_gracia_s_deck }} from 2009 is a good example.
