	The decklist proposed here is subject to change before reaching its highest level of

<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
	This is a <em>rush</em> deck based on mid-cap {{ POT }} vampires.
</p>
<p>
	Ordinary rush deck uses {{ ANI }} as the key discipline because {{ deep_song }}
	is both the means to rush and the means to oust the prey. There is no alternative to
	{{ deep_song }} for {{ POT }} decks. This means that the deck needs a means to rush
	and a means to oust the prey.
</p>
<p>
	As the name indicates, the choice here is to use {{ creeping_sabotage }} as a means
	to oust the prey. Its downside is that it has to be defended to be effective.
	Here comes {{ bums_rush }} to enter {{ combat }} with the prey's minions.
</p>

<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
	As {{ creeping_sabotage }} only deals damage to the prey, it is less likely that other
	players will try to use actions to destroy it. {{ bums_rush }} can then be used to
	reduce the number of {{ actions }} that the prey can use to attempt to destroy the
	{{ creeping_sabotage }}.
</p>
<p>
	If a prey or a predator has a good {{ range_management }} capability, {{ stealth }} can
	be used to secure the optional maneuver from {{ bums_rush }}.
</p>
<p>
	Using {{ the_warrens }} early in the game can dissuade some Methuselah to use actions
	to attempt to destroy {{ creeping_sabotage }}.
</p>

<h2>Tournament Version</h2>
<p>
	This deck has been inspired by two tournament archetypes: {{ nananimalism }} and
	{{ euro_brujah }}. Despite their different core discipline {{ ANI }} and {{ DOM }}
	respectively, the density of the {{ modules }} were of great help to design this deck.
