<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>rush</em> deck using the {{ ANI }}{{ POT }} disciplines combination.
    {{ nana_buruku }} is used for additional Master actions,
    playing {{ ashur_tablets }} for recursion and {{ anarch_revolt }}
    for additional pool damage.
</p>
<p>
    {{ nangila_were }}, {{ enkidu_the_noah }} and/or {{ black_annis }}
    are used to rush the opponents minions
    and take them down with the powerful {{ ANI }}{{ POT }} combat module.
</p>
<p>
    {{ fame }} and {{ dragonbound }} are used to improve pool damage a bit.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ powerbase_luanda }} and {{ well_marked }} are nice tools
    for a <em>rush</em> deck.
</p>
<p>
    Just including a bit of <em>wakes</em> and some intercept enhancers like
    {{ cats_guidance }} and {{ sense_the_savage_way }}
    keeps the other players guessing on wether the deck can block or not.
</p>
<p>
    Getting {{ wider_view }} at some point helps rotating the crypt a little bit.
    {{ andre_le_roux }} is included as a bleed enhancer once all the prey's vampires
    are down.
</p>
<p>
    The combat module includes a lot of cards in single copy as specific counters.
    They're not likely to jam the hand and can be brought back by {{ ashur_tablets }}
    if need be.
</p>
<p>
    As the game moves along, the deck can use {{ ashur_tablets }} to concentrate
    the content of the deck on more bleed or more combat cards,
    depending on what's needed.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    The <strong>Laibon</strong> variant does not go Anarch and can get more toolboxy,
    using {{ PRE }} for {{ enchant_kindred }} and the excellent
    {{ founders_of_the_ebony_kingdom }}.
    {{ grooming_the_protégé }} also helps getting vampires out faster.
    {{ michael_heyder_s_deck }} from the 2009 NAC is a good example.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Girls</strong> variant does not go Anarch either and simply focuses on more
    {{ ashur_tablets }}, like {{ jorge_delgado_s_deck }} from 2014 Spanish NC.
    {{ carver_s_meat_packing_and_storage }} and {{ tension_in_the_ranks }} can be added
    to help the rush side of things.
