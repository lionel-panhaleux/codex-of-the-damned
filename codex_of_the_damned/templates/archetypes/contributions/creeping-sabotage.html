<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
	This deck uses neither bleed nor vote to deliver pool damage but uses {{ anarch_revolt }},
	{{ army_of_rats }} and {{ creeping_sabotage }}. This way of ousting one's prey disables
	a lot of usual defensive modules such as {{ bounce }} or {{ delay }}.
</p>
<p>
	This strategy costs a bit of blood and those cards need to be defended. We go mid-cap
	for speed and {{ a_b }}. The key here is having the upper hand in {{ combat }} hence the
	use {{ POT }} as a core discipline of the deck as it is great at dealing high damage.
</p>
<p>
	Nosferatus {{ img_clan_nosferatu }} are good at {{ ani }}, {{ obf }} and {{ pot }} disciplines,
	{{ slag }} and {{ ryan }} for example. Some even have a built-in {{ rush }} action
	({{ ebanezer_roush }} and {{ gustave_brunnelle }}) but they are not used because of their
	higher capacity and the low presence of mid-cap {{ POT }} vampires in their grouping.
</p>
<p>
	This {{ rush }} strategy leads to {{ finnish_politics }}. Its point is to use {{ rush }}
	as a means of negociation with the other players. Played with {{ immortal_grapple }}, it
	becomes a huge threat to {{ s_ce }} defensive modules. It is also the only defense against an
	aggressive predator.
</p>
<p>
	We go with {{ bums_rush}} and {{ haven_uncovered }} despite {{ ANI }} giving access to
	{{Â deep_song }}. As the point is to disable {{ bounce }}, it would go against that
	objective because {{ bleed }} for 2 are nice to bounce.
</p>

<h2>Range Management</h2>
<p>
	{{ range_management }} is sometimes hard to deal with. Here are some {{ POT }} cards
	that can be used and each one of them is a metacall answer:
</p>
<p>
	{{ thrown_sewer_lid }} is great against {{ CEL }} guns decks because of the relatively
	high density of maneuvers in the deck. {{ anson_guns }} is a common build for this kind
	of deck.
</p>
<p>
	{{ slam }} works fine against decks with few maneuver cards but yet depend on it.
	For example, {{ ANI }} decks like {{ nananimalism }} relies heavily on {{ aid_from_bats }}
	but it does not play other cards to maneuver.
</p>
<p>
	{{ improvised_tactics }} is a more neutral card. It is possible to cycle it away at no cost
	and even get an extra card from time to time with a vampire with {{ aus }}. This card may
	be played when few long range decks are expected.
</p>
<p>
	This deck has some other ways to deal with {{ range_management }} as it may be a weakness
	of {{ POT }} oriented combat modules:
</p>
<p>
	It is possible to use {{ stealth }} to avoid blocks on {{ bums_rush }} to profit from its
	built-in optional maneuver.
</p>
<p>
	{{ shadow_boxing }} and {{ swallowed_by_the_night }} provide maneuver options. The other
	parts of those cards are also playable and provide versatility to the deck.
</p>

<h2>Protecting our ousting engine</h2>
<p>
	Running {{ intercept }} and {{ wake_and_unlock }} cards can prevent other player destroying
	our key cards.
</p>
<p>
	{{ intercept }} cards like {{ the_warrens }} or {{ carlton_van_wyk }} help blocking those
	actions. Once one of them has been played, players will have to consider you have some in
	hand before attempting to play against you.
</p>
<p>
	{{ wake_and_unlock }} cards are played to maximise our {{ a_b }}. It is possible to lock
	all of our vampires to do {{ rush }} actions or playing {{ creeping_sabotage }} and have
	them stop our opponents in their tracks.
</p>
<p>
	It is possible to use retaliation {{ rush }} as a threat to a player attempting to destroy
	one of your ousting card. This kind of dissuasion is best against decks that fear either
	{{ combat }} as a whole or decks that only use {{ s_ce }}.
