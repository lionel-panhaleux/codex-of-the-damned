<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>toolbox</em> deck using {{ deep_song }} to rush
    or bleed and a {{ ANI }} block and combat module.
</p>
<p>
    Using {{ nana_buruku }} allows the inclusion of a lot of {{ ashur_tablets }}
    for a nice recursion. This lets the deck adapt to the table context while bloating.
    {{ anarch_revolt }} and {{ deep_song }} are used to deal pool damage and, of course,
    the incidental {{ fame }} can help.
</p>
<p>
    {{ deep_song }}'s versatility is at the core of this deck, as often in {{ ANI }}
    decks. It can be used to bleed or to rush a cumbersome minion depending on the
    situation. The deck has decent defense with a bit of intercept, especially once a
    {{ raven_spy }} or two hit the table. {{ underbridge_stray }} helps with the wakes,
    making an opponent think twice before acting, but can also provide a welcome press
    when using {{ carrion_crows }} in a combat.
</p>
<p>
    The combat module relies on the usual {{ aid_from_bats }} + {{ carrion_crows }}
    long range {{ ANI }} module, with a couple of {{ canine_horde }} against weapons
    like {{ magnum }}, and the occasional {{ hell_for_leather }} for a dodge when things
    get too hairy.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ powerbase_luanda }} is a nice tool for such a deck with decent combat abilities.
    Orian comments on the decklist that {{ fish }} should replace {{ effie_lowery }}
    here just because of this card.
</p>
<p>
    The deck does not have a lot of intercept, but plays
    {{ powerbase_montreal }} and {{ the_rack }} nonetheless, relying on the threat of
    a retaliation rush to protect them.
</p>
<p>
    Without {{ bounces }}, the deck defense is pretty low, so it might need to rush
    back a bit, at least until a {{ raven_spy }} or two are employed.
    {{ archon_investigation }} is also almost mandatory here, and could be doubled
    if heavy bleeds are to be expected.
</p>
<p>
    Getting {{ wider_view }} at some point helps getting rid
    of the spurious {{ nana_buruku }} in crypt.
    She's also only played in 4 copies to avoid jamming the crypt too much;
    other minions are needed for the deck to work well.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    As often with toolboxes, a lot of potential tweaks are possible here.
    {{ the_anarch_free_press }} is a very common inclusion and {{ terror_frenzy }}
    or {{ target_vitals }} can be considered for the combat module.
    {{ aranthebes_the_immortal }} for defense or
    {{ codex_of_the_edenic_groundskeepers }} might also fit here.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Weenie ANI</strong> variant plays {{ ani }} without {{ nana_buruku }}
    nor {{ ashur_tablets }}. It is arguably less versatile, and more of a rush deck
    than a toolbox deck, but it's still very strong.
    {{ kim_nilsson_s_deck }} from the 2016 Swedish NC is a good example.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Resistência</strong> variant, played by {{ mailton_silva }}, ditches the
    {{ ashur_tablets }} to focus on a lot more {{ anarch_revolt }}. It is also leaning
    a bit more on the rush side, with only a few reaction cards to keep the opponents on
    their toes: the plan is to rush any Anarch vampire the prey could have to make sure
    the damage from {{ anarch_revolt }} is properly applied.
