<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>toolbox</em> deck starring {{ malgorzata }}, using the rare
    {{ AUD }}{{ VIC }}{{ THA }} disciplines combination and big capacity vampires
    with great abilities.
</p>
<p>
    {{ malgorzata }}'s unique ability helps influencing a big capacity vampire fast.
    Then {{ mistress_fanchon }} or {{ sha_ennu }} hit the table - they can bleed
    hard, but also have the same disciplines as {{ malgorzata }}, so they can do
    whatever she does. The classical {{ zillah_s_valley }} + {{ villein }} combination
    is used to speed up this setup even further.
</p>
<p>
    {{ VIC }} makes for a dreadful combat module, with {{ chiropteran_marauder }} and
    {{ breath_of_the_dragon }} delivering aggravated damage at any range.
    A couple of {{ rotschreck }} helps cover almost any the combat cases when blocking.
</p>
<p>
    The deck includes a solid defense module based on {{ AUS }}, with
    {{ telepathic_misdirection }} to bounce and a lot of wakes and intercept for
    general defense.
</p>
<p>
    Both {{ mistress_fanchon }} and {{ sha_ennu }} have a +2 bleed ability, and the deck
    provides quite a bit of stealth with {{ changeling }}, {{ mirror_walk }} and
    {{ plasmic_form }}. A couple of {{ conditioning }} are added for the lunge.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ direct_intervention }} is great against block denial cards like
    {{ elder_impersonation }}. A lot of cards might be worth cancelling, but a
    properly timed {{ direct_intervention }} can real make or break a game.
</p>
<p>
    {{ magic_of_the_smith }} can be used to fetch any of the included equipment,
    depending on what is most useful for the current table situation. If nothing
    specific arises, {{ heart_of_nizchetus }} is a good default.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    The deck leaves a lot of room to variations due to its toolbox nature.
    One needs to tinker with it and adapt it to the expected {{ meta }} but it is
    certainly suitable in many situations.
</p>
    The <strong>Diablerie</strong> variation includes a far more severe combat module.
    Seen first in {{ bram_van_stappen_s_deck }} from 2015, it can execute diablerie
    upon diablerie on the opposing vampires. {{ the_erciyes_fragments }} is a great
    inclusion here given the good defense and discipline spread,
    and {{ scourge_of_the_enochians }} a good counter against some swarm decks.
    Relying on the {{ chiropteran_marauder }} maneuver to include {{ mark_v }} is a
    great idea. {{ nicolas_deck }} from 2017 is another example of this build.
</p>
<p>
    Actually, {{ malgorzata }}'s ability might be less relevant to the whole strategy
    than one could think at first sight. The <strong>Sha-Ennu</strong> variant
    ditches her in favor of {{ unmada }}. This allow for the use of {{ obf }} instead
    of {{ THA }}, for more stealth, as in {{ tuomas_deck }} from 2015.
    The inclusion of {{ nightmare_curse }} for {{ sha_ennu }} is a nice
    trick that could be used in other versions: coupled with {{ banishment }} and
    the occasional diablerie, this can really shake a table.
