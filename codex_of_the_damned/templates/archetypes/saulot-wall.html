<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>wall</em> deck starring {{ saulot_the_wanderer }} and
    {{ the_capuchin }}, with some sidekicks with the {{ AUS }}{{ FOR }} disciplines.
</p>
<p>
    They all get <em>Anarch</em> using {{ anarch_convert }},
    and that allows them to use good <em>Anarch</em> cards like {{ anarch_revolt }},
    {{ the_anarch_free_press }}, {{ monkey_wrench }} and {{ guardian_vigil }}.
</p>
<p>
    The idea is to block problematic actions both from the prey and the predator,
    using {{ AUS }} for intercept, weapons and {{ FOR }} for combat damage prevention.
    The deck slowly builds up a strong position and delivers some well-timed bleeds
    to the prey.
</p>
<p>
    {{ anarch_revolt }} and {{ smiling_jack_the_anarch }} help
    improve pool damage, and {{ monkey_wrench }} can be used for the lunge.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ sire_s_index_finger }} is a good counter against {{ deep_song }} at superior and
    {{ rötschreck }}, but also against {{ ani }} frenzy cards commonly played
    against weapons: {{ drawing_out_the_beast }} and {{ terror_frenzy }}.
</p>
<p>
    {{ the_rack }} is very strong in combination with {{ saulot }}'s ability:
    together, they make for a nice bloat.
</p>
<p>
    {{ hidden_strength }} is a good way to prevent aggravated damage,
    but also to prevent the use of damage-based cards like
    {{ taste_of_vitae }} and {{ disarm }}, or a combat from continuing after a
    {{ trap }} or {{ aid_from_bats }}.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    There are not many variants for this archetype. The <em>Anarch</em> option is rarely
    used, {{ daniel_abreu_s_deck }} from 2016 is a good example of doing it without the
    <em>Anarch</em> tech.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Anesthesia</strong> variant uses {{ anesthetic_touch }} as the core
    of the combat module, like in {{ martins_deck }} from 2020. It ditches
    {{ the_capuchin }}, relying on {{ saulot }} and one or two sidekicks. But
    {{ anesthetic_touch }} — with enough maneuvers — can handle most combat modules out
    there, wether they chose to rely on {{ immortal_grapple }}, {{ aid_from_bats }}
    or {{ magnum }}. The payload is light but, in a combat heavy environment, it can
    profit from the overall grind pretty much unscathed.
