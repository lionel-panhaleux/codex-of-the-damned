<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>stealth & bleed</em> deck centered around the use of multiple Master actions
    and a lot of Master cards. This is commonly reffered to as a <strong>M</strong>ulti
    <strong>M</strong>aster <strong>P</strong>hase <strong>A</strong>ctions construct.
</p>
<p>
    The base idea is to get {{ cybele }} out, then {{ aksinya_daclau }}, using
    {{ zillah_s_valley }} and {{ villein }} to get them out faster.
</p>
<p>
    {{ cybele }} ability provides more master phase actions, while
    {{ aksinya_daclau }}'s ability also uses the Master cards
    for bleed defence, providing a permanent bounce.
</p>
<p>
    The deck has an exceptional bloat capacity, between {{ villein }},
    {{ liquidation }} and {{ ashur_tablets }}.
</p>
<p>
    While the game progresses, big capacity vampires with a strong permanent bleed bonus
    and {{ OBF }} are put into play. They proceed to destroying the prey's pool
    using {{ OBF }} stealth and their inherent bleed bonus.
</p>
<p>
    The high number of {{ ashur_tablets }} provide an exceptional recursion.
    The more the game advances, the more the deck concentrates the cards it needs
    the most, depending on the table context and the opponents decks.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ aksinya_daclau }} needs to be unlocked to use her ability.
    That's why the deck uses {{ guard_dogs }} and
    {{ rat_s_warning }}.
</p>
<p>
    The crypt uses vampires with {{ OBF }} and {{ PRE }}, so they can use
    {{ entrancement }} and {{ majesty }}.
    However, most vampires do not have access to {{ dom }} or {{ AUS }} for additional bounces.
    As the vampires have a very big capacity though, {{ lost_in_translation }}
    provide additional bounces in case of a very aggressive predator.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    Many small variations exists, depending on the cards used outside the Master module.
</p>
<p>
    A common variation is the <strong>Girls Will Find AIDS</strong>,
    more combat-focused and using {{ nana_buruku }} and an {{ ANI }} combat module using
    {{ deep_song }}, {{ aid_from_bats }}, and {{ carrion_crows }}.
    {{ hugh_angseeing_s_deck }} from the 2011 NAC FCQ is a good example.
</p>
<p>
    {{ corey_brindelys_variation }} won him the 2019 NAC (and a few other tournaments).
    It is using {{ anson }} instead of {{ cybele }} as a base for multi-master,
    using the fact that he has {{ dom }} and a title to include a few votes and {{ dom }}
    cards. The whole crypt is different and the deck ditches {{ aksinya_daclau }} and
    {{ zillah_s_valley }}, for a slower start but a very strong middle game where
    suddenly {{ deflections }} are available and a few votes can be included.
