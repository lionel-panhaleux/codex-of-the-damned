<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>allies toolbox</em> deck using {{ emerald_legionnaire }}.
</p>
<p>
    This version uses {{ erlik }} as a star: his ability lets the player get
    another Harbinger out fast and cheap. The fact that he has {{ CEL }} lets him use
    the excellent {{ forced_march }} for stealth and unlock.
</p>
<p>
    The idea is to defend and get an {{ emerald_legionnaire }} out,
    then bring the others back from the ash heap if they are there.
    Once {{ the_unmasking }} and {{ fbi_special_affairs_division }} hit the table,
    they're a solid defence.
</p>
<p>
    {{ liquidation }} is used to bloat and can put some {{ emerald_legionnaire }}
    but also the cards to power their ability in the ash heap.
</p>
<p>
    As the game progresses, {{ emerald_legionnaire }} are used to bleed.
    {{ vengeful_spirit }} helps to boost the Harbinger bleeds, too.
    {{ inevitability_of_the_void }} is used to lunge.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    To be able to use their ability, an {{ emerald_legionnaire }} must be put into play
    by recruiting it: the ones in the ash heap can not have their effect used â€”
    their card text is ignored as long as they are in the ash heap.
    In order to manage to get at least one into play, the deck packs quite a bit of
    stealth, and uses recruitment specialized modifiers like {{ shroud_mastery }} and
    {{ breath_of_thanatos }} .
</p>
<p>
    A key feature of this deck is the versatility of its cards:
    {{ spectral_divination }} can be used for stealth or intercept,
    {{ breath_of_thanatos }} for stealth or a deadly strike, and so on.
</p>
<p>
    The deck has quite a bit of intercept, but nothing close to what a
    <em>wall</em> construct can display. It will be happy enough to bounce the bleed
    with {{ AUS }} bounces if given the chance.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    A variant uses {{ the_capuchin }} as star, {{ richard_stefan_utners_deck }}
    from 2019 is a good example of it.
