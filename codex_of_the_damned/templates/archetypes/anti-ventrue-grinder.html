<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    Often spelled <strong>!Ventrue Grinder</strong>
    (the "!" prefix has been used to denote the antitribu clans for a while),
    this is a <em>toolbox</em> deck using the Ventrue antitribu clan and their {{for}}{{aus}}{{dom}}
    disciplines combination.
</p>
<p>
    The idea is to get the highest capacity vampire out,
    then use {{ govern_the_unaligned }}
    at superior {{ DOM }} to get more vampires out fast and cheap,
    then later to bleed with the help of {{ conditioning }} and {{ bonding }}.
</p>
<p>
    The intercept module uses {{ AUS }} for intercept, wakes and bounces, and {{ dom }} for additional
    bounces with {{ deflection }}.
</p>
<p>
    The combat module uses {{ for }} for damage prevention and
    {{ weighted_walking_stick }} to deal more damage.
</p>
<p>
    The deck is on the slow side, {{ grinding }} at the opponents blood and pool
    during the game until it can finally lunge to oust its prey.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ daring_the_dawn }} is kept for the lunge.
</p>
<p>
    The deck has not much stealth, so it uses some <em>powerbleed</em> techniques, like
    {{ pentex_subversion }} and {{ anarch_troublemaker }}.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    There are many small variations to this archetype:
    <li>
        {{ the_coven }} is a rare inclusion: the deck is supposed
        to grind the blood out of the table, so giving opponents the opportunity to
        get some back is a bit of a stretch. {{ the_rack }} is more often seen.
    </li>
    <li>
        {{ the_kiss_of_ra }}, {{ misdirection }} and
        {{ seduction }} can be used to help get the bleed through.
    </li>
    <li>
        {{ abbot }}, {{ bowl_of_convergence }} and permanent intercept
        locations like {{ krcg_news_radio }}
        are often included to help with intercept.
    </li>
    <li>
        {{ ivory_bow }} and {{ target_vitals }}
        are often seen in the combat module.
    </li>
    <li>
        {{ freak_drive }} is sometimes added to increase {{ a_b }}.
    </li>
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Guns Grinder</strong> variant uses
    {{ concealed_weapon }} and guns in the combat module,
    like in {{ ravel_zorzals_deck }} from the 2016 Brazilian NC.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Protean Grinder</strong> variant uses
    {{ lazverinus_thrall_of_lambach }} and
    {{ dylan }} in the crypt for {{ pro }}, in order to include
    {{ claws_of_the_dead }} and {{ earth_meld }}.
    {{ jackson_iribarrens_deck }} won the 2009 SAC with it.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Powerbleed</strong> variant focuses on bleed more,
    using only {{ aura_reading }} with some {{ for }} prevention for the combat module.
    {{ bob_josephs_deck }} won the 2018 NAC with it.
