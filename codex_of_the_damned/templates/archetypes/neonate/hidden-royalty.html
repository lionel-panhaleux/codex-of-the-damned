<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is an <em>vote</em> deck relying on <em>Princes</em> with {{ obf }}.
</p>
<p>
    There are multiple ways to approach this build given the variety of good <em>Princes</em> in the {{ v5_precons }}.
    This example focuses on getting a bit of {{ dom }} in the mix alongside {{ pre }}, to give access
    to great cards like {{ govern_the_unaligned }} for faster setup and {{ deflection }} for defence.
</p>
<p>
    The plan is to get <em>Princes</em> in play fast with {{ information_highway }} and
    {{ govern_the_unaligned }} for the vote lock, then use {{ parity_shift }} to bloat
    and {{ kine_resources_contested }} for additional damage.
    {{ obf }} provides a welcome support with stealth modifiers to ensure the votes do not get blocked easily.
</p>
<p>
    {{ pre }} provides useful vote-oriented support like {{ perfect_paragon }} and {{ voter_captivation }},
    while {{ dom }} gives access to a bit of bleed to complement the votes if necessary, with
    {{ conditioning }} and {{ foreshadowing_destruction }}.
</p>
<p>
    A few Master cards help with the vote lock: {{ elysium_the_palace_of_versailles }} and {{ ventrue_headquarters }},
    but also {{ fear_of_mekhet }}, an excellent card to get rid of a cumbersome <em>Inner Circle</em> or
    <em>Justicar</em>.
</p>
<h2>Tweaks and variants</h2>
<p>
    This specific build includes neither combat defense not intercept, like {{ majesty }}
    or {{ second_tradition_domain }}. Depending on the {{ meta }} you expect, both are options to consider.
    Although not yet reprinted, {{ forgotten_labyrinth }} is an excellent fit.
</p>
<p>
    An interesting variant, if you have access to legacy cards, is to use some {{ reckless_agitation }} for
    more damage. {{ arishat }} can play it and, since her ability is already great, you will
    want to triple her. At her side, a pair of <em>Barons</em> to help, like {{ jacques_rouge }} and
    either another Nosferatu {{ nosferatu }}, or a Ministry {{ ministry }}.
    Going this way means the vampires will need their blood, so less {{ villein }}. More importantly,
    the crypt loses {{ dom }} so the bleed defence with {{ deflection }} goes out,
    and needs to be compensated with more {{ parity_shift }}. Bram Van Stappen's deck {{ infernal_princes_of_anarchy }},
    played by Emiliano Imeroni, won the 2021 Belgian National Tournament using this kind of variation,
    with the adjunction of {{ ashur_tablets }}.
</p>
<h2>What to buy</h2>
<p>
    Most of the cards are from {{ v5_precons }}, Malkavian {{ malkavian }}, Ventrue {{ ventrue }} and
    Toreador {{ toreador }}, plus {{ fb_malkavian }} for stealth cards {{ elder_impersonation }}
    and {{ veil_the_legions }}, and the {{ anniversary }} for a few cards.
    The rest of the deck might be adapted to fit what you have available.
    The crypt is especially tricky to compose, with vampires from many different bundles,
    so don't hesitate to trade for them. Finally, the trickiest part might be to come up with enough
    {{ information_highway }} for the deck: alternatively, you can try only 4 and reduce the cards count under 70.
