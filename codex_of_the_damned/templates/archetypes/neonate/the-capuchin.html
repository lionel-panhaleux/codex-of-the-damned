<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>toolbox</em> deck using {{ the_capuchin }} as star vampire and {{ gerald_windham }} as a sidekick.
</p>
<p>
    The idea is similar to a {{ anti_ventrue_grinder }}: use {{ AUS }}{{ FOR }} for a solid grinder defence, with
    {{ DOM }} for bleed and additional bounces. In this deck, vampires are more expensive but they got {{ THA }} for
    additional useful tricks: {{ magic_of_the_smith }}Â to fetch useful equipments quickly, a bit of additional stealth
    with {{ mirror_walk }} and one of the best strikes of the game with {{ theft_of_vitae }}.
</p>
<p>
    The deck has a slow start but grinds the rest of the table strong enough to secure a win in the late game.
    Key actions should be blocked and bleed actions from the predator bounced once they get enough stealth on them.
    Thanks to {{ theft_of_vitae }} that can not be prevented and brings back a bit of blood on the vampires,
    the blood balance on the table should tip in favor of the deck as the game advances.
</p>
<p>
    The strategy is all about using the pressure of the slow grind and the good defence to survive and build up to
    a great {{ lunge }}. Taking the time to craft the perfect hand to oust the prey in a single swift move is
    particularily important here. Luckily, {{ the_capuchin }}'s ability gives you a good hand size so you can
    seat on good cards you want to keep.
</p>
<h2>Tweaks and variants</h2>
<p>
    A number of tweaks can be done depending on the {{ meta }}: {{ seduction }} and {{ bonding }}
    can provide more stealth, {{ soul_burn }} or {{ blood_rage }} are great against weapons and {{ for }}
    prevention, and {{ apportation }} can help with mobility. Allies like {{ mylan_horseed }}, 
    {{ carlton_van_wyk }} and {{ ponticulus }} are also worth considering. {{ enkil_cog }} might be worth doubling and
    one or two {{ direct_intervention }} can't hurt. More permanent
    intercept is not desirable: you still want bleeds to get through so you can bounce them.
    {{ the_rack }} and {{ heart_of_nizchetus }} are worthy additions, but not really necessary.
    Finally, you might want to dial down on the {{ conditioning }} in favor of more {{ murmur_of_the_false_will }}
    if you are in a bleed intensive environment rich in {{ archon_investigation }}.
</p>
<p>
    {{ saulot_the_wanderer }} is another possible partner for {{ the_capuchin }},
    as in {{ danilo_torrisi_s_deck }} from the 2017 EC. {{ DOM }} becomes less relevant, but is not required,
    since {{ saulot }} cannot be brought out by {{ govern_the_unaligned }} anyway.
    {{ saulot }}'s ability might well be worth the loss, especially when combined with {{ the_rack }}.
</p>
<p>
    A few legacy cards are great additions:
    {{ erebus_mask }} and {{ eagles_sight }} should be added if available.
    {{ depravity }}, {{ metro_underground }}, {{ sniper_rifle }} and  {{ my_enemys_enemy }} are worth considering.
    {{ karl_schrekt }} might also fit here.
</p>
<p>
    Making more use of Anarch tech is possible: bumping up the number of {{ anarch_convert }} might open the possibility
    of {{ anarch_revolt }} for offense, combined with a number of {{ guardian_vigil }} for defence.
    Anarchs also have access to {{ the_anarch_free_press }}. All in all, this leads up to a whole different
    deck, closer to a wall. In this case, using {{ angelique }} instead of {{ gerald_windham }},
    coupled with some {{ vengeful_spirit }} and {{ emerald_legionnaire }}, might be a better bet than using {{ DOM }}.
    {{ NEC }} can also provide additional stealth and combat options.
</p>
<h2>What to buy</h2>
<p>
    A {{ promo_pack_1 }} for {{ the_capuchin }}, {{ keepers_of_tradition_2 }} and {{ anthology }} to complete the crypt,
    two {{ anniversary}} plus {{ v5_tremere }}, {{ v5_ventrue }} and {{ fb_ventrue }} for the library.
    An optional {{ v5_banu_haqim }} if you want to use {{ blood_rage }} or {{ soul_burn }}, and a few cards
    from {{ fb_nosferatu }} and {{ den_of_fiends }} that can be traded instead.
    A tricky point will be to get enough {{ dreams_of_the_sphinx }}, but you can adjust the decklist with less of them.
