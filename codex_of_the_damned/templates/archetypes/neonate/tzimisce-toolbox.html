<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>toolbox</em> deck using Tzimisce {{ tzimisce }} vampires.
</p>
<p>
    The idea is to bank on the very versatile {{ ANI }} discipline: completed by {{ VIC }} for bleed and combat,
    and {{ AUS }} for intercept, it makes for a very balanced toolbox.
</p>
<p>
    As usual toolboxes, cards rotation is key: card draw will determine play and you should aim to maximise the effect
    of the cards you get, but also adapt your strategy to what you get in hand. The deck is very balanced: 
    it can bleed solidly with {{ deep_song }} and {{ changeling }}, but also rush with {{ deep_song }} to disable
    a problematic blocker or bouncer with the {{ ANI }} and {{ VIC }} combat cards.
</p>
<p>
    Although not really a wall, the deck has good block capabilities with a number of wakes and, more importantly,
    a good number of {{ telepathic_misdirection }} to bounce your predator's bleeds. Those will add to your own
    bleeds to put a better pressure on your prey. As you don't want to jam your hand with intercept and wakes though,
    you'll have to choose carefully what to block on your prey and predator side. Additional defence is provided by
    {{ under_siege }} and the two Master cards {{ channel_10 }} and {{ guardian_angel }}.
</p>
<p>
    The combat module focuses on maintaining long range with {{ aid_from_bats }}, potentially adding a bit more damage
    when necessary with {{ carrion_crows }}, or use aggravated damage with {{ breath_of_the_dragon }} and
    {{ chiropteran_marauder }} if the opportunity arises.
</p>
<h2>Tweaks and variants</h2>
<p>
    You might want to check {{ information_highways_article }} for a cheaper build for the Tzimisce {{ tzimisce }}
    clan, using more of a wall approach.
</p>
<p>
    If you got access to legacy cards, a handful of Master cards are worth considering: {{ rotschreck }} is a deadly
    tool to handle combats when you block, {{ powerbase_barranquilla }} and {{ black_forest_base }} could be
    added for a bit more bloat.
    {{ the_admonitions }} could replace a {{ dreams_of_the_sphinx }}. On the crypt side,
    {{ lady_zara_slatikov }} and {{ laika }} could provide a bit of diversity although, if you have access to legacy
    vampire you might prefer to have a look to the excellent group 2/3 possibilities for the Tzimisce {{ tzimisce }}.
    Finally, {{ fiendish_tongue }} deserves a look: if you expect a few Anarch decks, it might be a better fit here
    than {{ deep_song }}.
</p>
<p>
    There are a number of minute adjustments one can make to this deck depending on the {{ meta }}. 
    {{ carlton_van_wyk }} could be good, {{ heart_of_nizchetus }} is also a very good fit in toolbox builds.
    {{ krcg_news_radio }} could be added to second {{ channel_10 }}. {{ living_manse }} and {{ plasmic_form }} could
    be added to the mix for stronger bleeds.
</p>
<p>
    There are a few examples revolving around the core idea of this deck that won recent tournaments:
    {{ high_angseesings_deck }} from the 2020 UK Nationals is a similar build, more focused on offence
    with a lot of {{ plasmic_form }} and {{ fiendish_tongue }} instead of {{ deep_song }}.
    {{ juan_rodriguez_deck }} from the 2021 SAC is an interesting variation, with {{ asanbonsam_ghoul }} and a couple
    of {{ war_ghoul }} to increase defence (both available on {{ print_on_demand }}).
</p>
<h2>What to buy</h2>
<p>
    A couple of {{ den_of_fiends }}, plus a {{ anniversary }} and a {{ fb_nosferatu }}. A few additional cards
    can be traded or found in other bundles like {{ pact_with_nephandi }}, {{ parliament_of_shadows }} and
    {{ v5_nosferatu }}. {{ direct_intervention }} can be found on {{ print_on_demand }}. 
    {{ righteous_endeavor }} was part of the {{ kickstarter }} reprint and can be traded or replaced by
    {{ lady_vadislava }}.
