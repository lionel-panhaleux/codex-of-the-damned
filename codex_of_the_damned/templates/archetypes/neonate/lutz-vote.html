<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>bleed & vote</em> deck using Malkavian {{ malkavian }} <em>Inner Circle</em>
    {{ lutz_von_hohenzollern }} and <em>Justicar</em> {{ unmada }}.
</p>
<p>
    The plan is to get {{ lutz }} and one or two sidekick <em>Prince</em> or <em>Justicar</em> out, using
    the {{ zillahs_valley }} + {{ villein }} combination to get them out fast and cheap.
    Once there, the vote lock should be easy, with a few {{ perfect_paragon }} to help just in case.
    The sidekicks can use {{ parity_shift }} to bloat a bit, but the bulk of the damage will come from
    {{ kine_resources_contested }} and {{ banishment }} provides additional control.
    In all cases, {{ lutz }}' ability kicks in for additional damage.
</p>
<p>
    {{ OBF }} is used for stealth, and {{ PRE }} to get some blood back with {{ voter_captivation }} and combat
    defence in the form of {{ combat_ends }} like {{ majesty }} and {{ force_of_personality }}. Incidentally,
    it also provides a couple of {{ entrancement }} to allow stealing critical allies like {{ carlton_van_wyk }}.
</p>
<p>
    {{ lutz }} can be used to either call a vote or bleed for 3, depending on the situation.
    A bit of bleed defence is included with {{ telepathic_misdirection }}, but the deck relies a lot more on {{ bloat }}
    to stay alive, with {{ villein }} for 5 and {{ parity_shift }}.
</p>
<h2>Tweaks and variants</h2>
<p>
    {{ enkil_cog }} is a common inclusion, as well as {{ scourge_of_the_enochians }} against swarms.
    {{ dark_influences }} could be considered, since it's a good counter against {{ direct_intervention }},
    a pretty annoying defence against {{ entrancement }} and "once per game" votes.
    A bit of additional {{ telepathic_misdirection }} might be in order in a bleed-heavy meta, in which case
    some wakes in the form of {{ eyes_of_argus }} and {{ on_the_qui_vive }} might help.
    If you have access to legacy cards, {{ undele }} is a very common crypt inclusion.
</p>
<p>
    Another worthy alternative is to use not-yet-reprinted {{ maris_streck }} as the main sidekick to {{ lutz }}.
    Her ability, coupled with a few {{ second_tradition_domain }} and {{ eyes_of_argus }}, improves the deck
    blocking ability, providing better defence overall but also opening the possibility of {{ mental_maze }}
    (available as {{print_on_demand}}) for rush defence: a sturdy counter against combat-oriented decks.
</p>
<p>
    The {{ main_article }} about the archetype presents additional variants.
</p>
<h2>What to buy</h2>
<p>
    The bulk of the cards come from two {{ keepers_of_tradition_1 }}, a {{ v5_malkavian }}, {{ anniversary }}
    and {{ first_blood_malkavian }}.
    The {{ v5_toreador }}, {{ libertine_ball }} and {{ keepers_of_tradition_2 }} provide useful additions to that base,
    but might be spared provided you adjust the decklist or trade a few cards.
