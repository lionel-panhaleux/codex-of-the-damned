<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is an <em>rush</em> deck using Nosferatu {{ nosferatu }} primogens and {{ ANI }} bleed & combat.
</p>
<p>
    {{ deep_song }} is the cornerstone of the deck's strategy. It serves as a bleed or rush device depending
    on the situation. The {{ ANI }} combat module, using {{ aid_from_bats }} and {{ carrion_crows }}, is
    supported by additional maneuvers from {{ swallowed_by_the_night }}. The plan is to use the rush abilities of the
    deck to keep control of the table, disable potential {{ bounces }} on the prey side by taking down vampires,
    then bleed for the oust.
</p>
<p>
    Playing Nosferatu {{ nosferatu }} allows a few {{ creeping_sabotage }} in addition to
    {{ army_of_rats }} for more pool damage. Both {{ larissa_moreira }} and {{ lenny_burkhead }} have a good
    bleed bonus, and {{ the_dowager }} has a very neat intercept bonus. Playing Primogen allows for the inclusion
    of the new {{ protected_district }}, a very nice defensive tool, both on the bleed and the political side.
</p>
<p>
    The only stealth used is {{ swallowed_by_the_night }} because of its versatility: it can easily be cycled
    during a combat or provide and additional maneuver to stay at long range on top of {{ aid_from_bats }}.
    Adding more stealth to the deck will most likely disrupt the balance and fluidity of the combat and
    reaction modules.
</p>
<h2>Tweaks and variants</h2>
<p>
    There are a lot of possible strategies with these Nosferatu {{ nosferatu }} primogens. Leaning on a more defensive
    side, with more {{ creeping_sabotage }} and reactions like {{ cats_guidance }} and {{ the_warrens }} is also a
    possibility - in that case obviously, far less {{ deep_song }} and a reduced combat module are in order.
</p>
<p>
    A few good potential inclusions have not yet been reprinted, especially when it comes down to the combat
    module. A few {{ target_vitals }} could be replaced by some {{ terror_frenzy }} or {{ canine_horde }}, to counter
    opposing combat modules revolving around close range strikes or weapons like {{ magnum }}.
</p>
<p>
    The balance of the deck when it comes down to proportions heavily depends on your local {{ meta }}. More
    {{ deep_song }} might be required against <em>Combat Ends</em>, or even a few {{ immortal_grapple }}.
    {{ scourge_of_the_enochians }} and even {{ anarchist_uprising }} might be included against swarm decks.
    {{ heart_of_nizchetus }} can also be a useful inclusion, although it does not feel required.
</p>
<h2>What to buy</h2>
<p>
    The bulk of the cards come from two {{ v5_nosferatu }} decks, with additions from {{ keepers_of_tradition_1 }},
    {{ anthology }}, {{ v5_malavian }} and {{ fb_nosferatu }}. {{ direct_intervention }} is available as
    {{ print_on_demand }}.
