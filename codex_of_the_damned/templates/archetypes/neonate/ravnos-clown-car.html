<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>swarm</em> deck where Ravnos {{ ravnos }} use {{ embraces }} to proliferate, {{ consanguineous_boon }}
    to bloat and bleed with their swarm for the kill.
</p>
<p>
    The plan is to have a horde of <em>Laibon</em> Ravnos {{ ravnos }} vampires. Get a vampire out as fast as
    possible, use {{ mozambique_allure }} to become Laibon and unlock, then {{ embrace }}. When you get the chance,
    play a {{ ravnos_carnival }} to help you pay for {{ the_embrace }}. Continue to grow your horde, then call
    {{ consanguineous_boon }} with {{ the_eldest_are_kholo }} to bloat and recruit even more Ravnos. Once you have
    enough vampires to kill your prey, start bleeding. {{ week_of_nightmares }} can help you lunge with style.
</p>
<p>
    The deck is hard to stop because of the high number of +1 stealth actions. Once it is settled with enough vampires,
    it is virtually unstoppable. A few subtleties deserve a note: rescuing your vampires from
    torpor might not be necessary - they still count as controlled for the {{ consanguineous_boon }} so, if you do not
    need their votes or actions you can just leave them be. Also note that {{ mozambique_allure }} can be used to
    draw a crypt card if all your vampires are already Laibon. Finally, {{ the_eldest_are_kholo }} can also be used
    as a reaction to stop an opponent's vote, but this should be done sparingly: you need it to get your
    {{ consanguineous_boon }} through.
</p>
<p>
    If you get too much attention on a table, especially if your neighbours keep minions unlocked with intercept ready,
    you can consider taking a static stance and just do nothing for a turn or two. Holding back to block actions that
    do not come can be very frustrating for them: just waiting it out can give you the opening you need to get the deck
    rolling.
</p>
<h2>Tweaks and variants</h2>
<p>
    You might want to check the {{ main_article }} on this archetype for other variants.
</p>
<p>
    The idea leaves room for interpretation and alternatives. You can, for example, include a few
    {{ kine_resources_contested }} for additional damage so you don't have to rely on the {{ week_of_nightmares }} so
    much. You can also have more modifiers to help you get the actions through: more {{ change_of_target }} can be used
    and most vampires in the crypt can use {{ chi }} for stealth with {{ fata_morgana }} or {{ mirror_image }}.
    {{ city_star_taxi }} and {{ strange_day }} are other possibilities, although they're not in print yet.
</p>
<p>
    If you have access to some legacy cards, consider replacing {{ life_in_the_city }} with a pair of {{ gird_minions }}.
    You might also want to include one or two {{ the_uncoiling }} to deal with problematic events like
    {{ the_unmasking }} or {{ scourge_of_the_enochians }}. An {{ aranthebes }} or two can also be nice,
    just to contest it if it gets out. Finally a few {{ bamba }} might help reduce the cost of these {{ embraces }}
    and {{ autarkis_persecution }} might bring a bit of vote diversity to fight back against {{ delaying_tactics }}.
</p>
<h2>What to buy</h2>
<p>
    Two {{ libertine_ball }} and a {{ anniversary }}, the rest of the cards can be found on {{ print_on_demand }}.
    {{ ashlesha }} is, for now, only available as a promo card from the {{ kickstarter }} in 2021. But you can replace
    her by {{ joaquina_amaya }} or just an {{ anarch_convert }}. {{ life_in_the_city }} ({{ v5_malkavian }}) and
    {{ heart_of_nizchetus }} ({{ anthology }}) can be traded or just cut out.
