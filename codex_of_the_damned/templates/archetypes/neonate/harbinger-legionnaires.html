<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is an <em>allies toolbox</em> deck relying on {{ emerald_legionnaire }}.
</p>
<p>
    Hoping to get {{ khurshid }} out fast as a first vampire, the deck relies on
    its strong combat ability coupled with {{ AUS }} for blocks. The plan is to get
    another Harbinger {{ harbinger_of_skulls }} out, then {{ anu_diptinatpa }}
    later in the game. All the while, using {{ liquidation }} for bloat and aiming to
    recruit an {{ emerald_legionnaire }} to bring back the others from the ash heap.
</p>
<p>
    The deck builds up slowly and steadily. Once an {{ emerald_legionnaire }} is out,
    he should be protected so he can bring back his mates from the ash heap on the next
    unlock phase. A few {{ vengeful_spirit }} can be stacked on the Harbinger vampires
    to augment the bleed power, {{ the_unmasking }} and {{ anu_diptinatpa }} both improve
    the {{ emerald_legionnaire }} capacities.
</p>
<p>
    The deck originality is in the inclusion of {{ gear_up }}, an excellent card when you got
    your ash heap full of cards and possibilities early thans to {{ liquidation }}.
    It also includes very specific counters and meta-related cards, like {{ soul_feasting }} against
    other {{ emerald_legionnaire }} builds or to remove one that was stolen, {{ trochomancy }}
    against decks that use their ash heap with {{ emerald_legionnaire }} or {{ ashur_tablets }},
    and {{ direct_intervention }} against {{ entrancement }} or {{ anarchist_uprising }} and similar votes.
</p>
<h2>Tweaks and variants</h2>
<p>
    The deck originates from the {{ emerald_legion }} archetype, but is mostly a tweak of
    Antti Penttilä's {{ khurshid_dream_team }}. As can be seen in the original list, a few
    non-BCP cards could be useful inclusions, like {{ erebus_mask }} and {{ my_enemys_enemy }}.
</p>
<p>
    Other small tweaks can be considered: adding more {{ dreams_of_the_sphinx }},
    if you're not concerned about too many contests, is a great way to cycle cards and fill
    your ash heap faster. The {{ heart_of_nizchetus }} is also worth consideration. Finally,
    the crypt can also be changed a bit: doubling either {{ anu_diptinatpa }} for bleed improvement
    or {{ angelique }} for blood economy makes sense.
</p>
<h2>What to buy</h2>
<p>
    Necromancy {{ nec }} cards are available on {{ print_on_demand }}, and the
    Harbinger {{ harbinger_of_skulls }} cards come from the {{ lost_kindred }} set.
    Most of the other cards come from {{ httb_a }} and {{ anthology }}.
    The last few cards can be found from diverse sets, like {{ V5 }} or {{ sabbat_precons }} decks, or
    replaced if you don't have them. {{ funeral_wake }} was included in the Kickstarter bundle
    {{ the_unaligned }}.
