<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>vote & bleed</em> deck using {{ stanislava }} and fellow Gangrel {{ gangrel }} royalty.
</p>
<p>
    The preconstructed decklist is already a top tier tournament archetype, only you might want to remove
    {{ fear_of_mekhet }}, a good counter to this deck that has nothing to do in it: it was a decklist printing error.
</p>
<h2>Tweaks and variants</h2>
<p>
    Although the decklist is already powerful, it still leaves a lot of room for tweaking it to your own style and
    local {{ meta }}. Minor tweaks are common, like removing the nerfed {{ pentex_subversion }} and a few
    {{ parity_shift }}, adding one or two {{ zillahs_valley }} and a {{ scourge_of_the_enochians }}, using a fifth
    {{ stanislava }} for a higher draw chance, doubling {{ ennoias_theater }} and {{ dreams_of_the_sphinx }},
    reducing the number of {{ earth_meld }}, adding a {{ banishment }} or two and removing {{ permanent_vacation }}.
    All these changes are judgment calls and depend on your {{ meta }}.
</p>
<p>
    One of the possible variants includes a number of changes: remove the {{ zillahs_valley }} to avoid jamming the hand
    and change the crypt a bit. {{ hartmut_stover }} can be removed to include more Gangrel.
    {{ ingrid_rossler }} in particular can be included in 4 copies with the idea of getting her out first.
    {{ ennoias_theater }} and {{ dreams_of_the_sphinx }} can both be doubled for a better chance to get her out in
    two turns. This gives access to her ability sooner, alleviates the absence of {{ zillahs_valley }} and can even
    let you remove a few {{ govern_the_unaligned }}. On the other hand if you remove {{ hartmut_stover }} and don't put
    enough {{ xaviar_adv }}, you're left with no decent sidekick for {{ enkil_cog }}: better remove it,
    it's a dangerous modifier to put on {{ stanislava }} because it leaves her open to an {{ archon_investigation }}.
</p>
<p>
    Another completely different idea, if you have access to legacy cards, is to include {{ alastor }} and
    {{ assault_rifle }} and double the number of {{ xaviar_adv }}. Both {{ stanislava }} and {{ xaviar_adv }} should
    be able to rush and vote in the same turn, a powerful combination. {{ anathema }} can even be added to the mix,
    as in {{ desso_alastors_deck }} from 2021.
</p>
<h2>What to buy</h2>
<p>
    This is a {{ anniversary }} deck straight out of the box. A second one is useful for a few tweaks.
