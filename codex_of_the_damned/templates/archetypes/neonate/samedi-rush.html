[10:26] Phoenix: This one you can only love ðŸ™‚ It's dreadful. Although I had a whole discussion with Darby who was
playing it in 2019 on EC WoN, and he gave me these few tips. Most of them don't apply because they're about old cards
that are worth the inclusion (Pulled Fangs, Carver's Meat), but he thought Baroque was the best in crypt there, because
of his ability.

TBH we could include Tension in the Ranks and Carver's Meat: They'll be available in 2 months, and the article will be
out only just shortly before this.
[10:27] Khormag, Prince of Joensuu: True! Carver is definitely a card to include in this. Tension can be good, but the
deck doesn't really need it.
[10:28] Phoenix: That's true
[10:38] Phoenix: So, maybe Carver and... What about Baroque? Maybe double it? I would go as far as to triple it.
[10:39] Khormag, Prince of Joensuu: Yep.
