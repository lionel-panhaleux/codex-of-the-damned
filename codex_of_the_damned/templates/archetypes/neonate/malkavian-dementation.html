<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a brutal <em>stealth & bleed</em> deck using Malkavian {{ malkavian }} and
    their legacy {{ dem }}.
</p>
<p>
    The plan is to bleed hard, with stealth. {{ kindred_spirits }} provides a bit of {{ bloat }} and {{ dem }} has great
    modifiers like {{ confusion }} and {{ eyes_of_chaos }}. The Master module provides
    a bit of bloat with {{ blood_doll }} and {{ villein }}, as well as card cycling tools like
    {{ dreams_of_the_sphinx }} and {{ the_barrens }}. But, most importantly, it includes counters against
    Master cards with {{ sudden_reversal }} and {{ wash }}: they're used to prevent bloat on the prey's side.
</p>
<p>
    {{ OBF }} is used for stealth, with a wide range of different modifiers so as to be able to stack them.
    It also provides {{ no_trace }}, the only combat defence of the deck. {{ AUS }} provides a bit of defence,
    with {{ telepathic_misdirection }} for bounces. Hand management is key: if a prey has only low
    intercept they might decide to never try to block to jam the hand with stealth.
</p>
<p>
    An interesting point about the deck is that {{ kindred_spirits }} allows to bleed <strong>any</strong> Methuselah,
    so one can even use it strategically against someone else, like their predator. Obviously though, it's best used
    on the prey as a rule of thumb.
</p>
<h2>Tweaks and variants</h2>
<p>
    A few {{ dem }} legacy cards are excellent additions to this deck, like 
    {{ deny }}, {{ restructure }} and {{ the_call }}. On the other hand, a few additional counters against Master cards
    can help too if you can trade for more {{ sudden_reversal }} and {{ wash }}. Some variations play a dozen
    of those to completely bar the prey from their Master module.
    Depending on the cases, you might find the library a bit short. If this is the case, adding a few 
    {{ kindred_spirits }} and half that amount of {{ confusion }} is an easy way to increase it.
</p>
<p>
    This is not the fastest crypt one can use for this build. The {{ main_article }} about the archetype presents
    alternatives if you have access to a few legacy cards. With a fast enough crypt, one can focuse completely on
    bleeding and forego bounces and bloat Masters altogether.
</p>
<h2>What to buy</h2>
<p>
    The bulk of the cards come from two {{ fb_malkavian }} and {{ v5_malkavian }}, with a few additions from
    {{ keepers_of_tradition_1 }}. The Master counters {{ sudden_reversal }} and {{ wash }} are the trickiest to come
    by: they can be found in the {{ sabbat_precons }} or should be traded for. {{ dreams_of_the_sphinx }} can be
    found in the {{ anniversary }}.
