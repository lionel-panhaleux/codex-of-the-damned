<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a brutal <em>stealth & bleed</em> deck using V5 Malkavian {{ malkavian }} and
    their newly regained {{ DOM }}.
</p>
<p>
    The plan is to bleed hard, with stealth. {{ govern_the_unaligned }} is probably the best available action card
    in the game. Used at superior after getting the oldest vampire out first, it provides fast and cheap vampires
    in the early game. Once at least three vampires are out and ready, it can then be used to bleed.
    {{ obf }} modifiers provide the required stealth.
</p>
<p>
    The Master module provides some cycling tools like {{ dreams_of_the_sphinx }} and {{ the_barrens }}. It also
    uses a good number of {{ sudden_reversal }}, since they amount to a good bleed when they counter a {{ villein }},
    a {{ blood_doll }} or a {{ liquidation }}. Moreover, they can be used to counter other painful Master:
    permanent intercept locations like {{ krcg_news_radio }} and {{ haven_uncovered }}.
    One {{ conceal }} is included too, since it can be used to destroy either a burdensome location or even an
    equipment like {{ bowl_of_convergence }}.
</p>
<p>
    The deck is fragile when it comes down to combat defence: only {{ no_trace }} can help there,
    and only a few vampires can play it at superior. To try and compensate for that, {{ secure_haven }}, 
    {{ carlton_van_wyk }} and {{ jake_washington }} are included as dispensable blockers against rushes.

</p>
<h2>Tweaks and variants</h2>
<p>
    There are a lot of ways to tweak this deck. {{ seduction }} is an option that might be worth including, since
    it's a good block denial card and it does not jam the hand. The balance between stealth, bleed and reactions
    is a delicate thing you might want to tinker with to adapt to your local {{ meta }}.
    A bit more blood generation is another possibility, with {{ papillon }} and {{ asylum_hunting_ground }},
    and maybe a couple of {{ blood_doll }} to go with. It would be a bit slower but maybe more resilient
    depending on the meta.
</p>
<p>
    If you do not have access to him, {{ gilbert_duane_g6 }} can be replace by the Nosferatu {{ nosferatu }} 
    {{ nathaniel_bordruff }} and {{ cedrick_calhoun }}.
</p>
<p>
    Fall of London is coming up, and in it two new Malkavian vampires you will probably want to include here:
    Abraham Mellon and Darius Shirazi. You can read more about those tweaks as well as other variants on the
    {{ information_highway_blog_article }} about the V5 Malkavian builds.
</p>
<h2>What to buy</h2>
<p>
    The bulk of the cards come from {{ v5_malkavian }} and two {{ nb_malkavian }}.
    {{ carlton_van_wyk }} and {{ sudden_reversal }} can be found in {{ pact_with_nephandi }}, although you will need
    two to get enough {{ sudden_reversal }} - maybe just trade or buy the missing two.
    {{ anniversary }} for {{ the_coven }} and the second {{ dreams_of_the_sphinx }} and, finally, 
    {{ jake_washington }} can be found in {{parliament_of_shadows }}.
