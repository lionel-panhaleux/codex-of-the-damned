<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a brutal <em>stealth & bleed</em> deck using V5 Malkavian {{ malkavian }} and
    their newly regained {{ DOM }}.
</p>
<p>
    The plan is to bleed hard, with stealth. {{ govern_the_unaligned }} is probably the best available action card
    in the game. Used at superior after getting the oldest vampire out first, it provides fast and cheap vampires
    in the early game. Once three vampires are out and ready, it can then be used to bleed.
    {{ obf }} modifiers provide stealth, but the crypt does not have that much superior {{ OBF }} available,
    so a few Master cards are included to provide even a bit more denial, like {{ pentex_subversion }}
    and {{ misdirection }}.
</p>
<p>
    The Master module provides a bit of bloat with {{ vessel }} and {{ villein }}, as well as card cycling tools like
    {{ dreams_of_the_sphinx }} and {{ the_barrens }}. Blood regeneration for the vampires is also important here, since
    {{ DOM }} tends to cost a bit of blood, so {{ perfectionist }} and {{ asylum_hunting_ground }} can help, as well
    as {{ jake_washington }} and {{ giants_blood }}.
</p>
<p>
    The lack of superior {{ OBF }} also makes the inclusion of {{ DOM }} cards like {{ bonding }} and {{ seduction }}
    relevant: additional stealth and a block denial that won't risk to jam the hand. On the same line, 
    {{ cloak_the_gathering }} is comparatively better, since a vampire with {{ OBF }} can use it at superior
    to help a sidekick. The deck is fragile when it comes down to combat defence: only {{ no_trace }} can help there,
    and only a few vampires can play it at superior. To try and compensate for that, {{ carlton_van_wyk }} and
    {{ jake_washington }} are included as dispensable blockers against rushes.

</p>
<h2>Tweaks and variants</h2>
<p>
    There are a lot of ways to tweak this deck. Including a good quantity of Master counters like {{ sudden_reversal }}
    and {{ wash }} is a good way to cripple the bloat possibilities for the prey. Another idea is to rely on {{ DOM }}
    more and increase the number of {{ bonding }} and {{ seduction }}, keeping {{ OBF }} only for the occasional
    boost or denial. Finally, the balance between stealth, bleed and reactions is a delicate thing you might
    want to tinker with to adapt to your local {{ meta }}.
</p>
<p>
    If you have access to him, {{ gilbert_duane_g6 }} is definitely a great addition to the crypt: he has superior
    {{ OBF }} and, with a capcity of 7 and a Baron title, sits comfortably in the "Govern chain" for the deck,
    even opening the possible inclusion of {{ papillon }} for blood regeneration. He is included in the
    {{ promo_pack_3 }}.
</p>
<h2>What to buy</h2>
<p>
    The bulk of the cards come from {{ v5_malkavian }}, {{ v5_tremere }} and {{ anniversary }}, with a few additions
    from {{ fb_malkavian }} and {{ fb_ventrue }}. A few cards are not in those, like {{ carlton_van_wyk }}
    ({{ anthology }}) and {{ jake_washington }} ({{parliament_of_shadows }}), but they can be traded or ignored.
