<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>stealth & bleed</em> deck of the Lasombra {{ lasombra }} clan,
    using the {{ DOM }}{{ OBT }} disciplines. It uses {{ govern_the_unaligned }}
    to get vampires out faster and cheaper in the beginning. When enough minions are into play,
    it switches to strong bleed actions using {{ OBT }} for stealth.
    {{ nocturn }} are used to protect its vampires from agression, but also to deliver more bleed in a single turn.
</p>
<p>
    The key is the balance between stealth and bleed amount: not enough stealth and the actions do not get through,
    too much and the hand will jam on it. Cunning opponents will be able to position themselves depending on their deck:
    if they have enough intercept, they will try to block every action to exhaust the stealth, while if they
    have no intercept they will avoid blocking to jam the hand on stealth. The deck includes some cycling devices
    like {{ dreams_of_the_sphinx }} and {{ the_barrens }} to avoid this.
</p>
<p>
    {{ seduction }} is great block denial, since it can either disable a high-intercept star blocker,
    or be cycled on just any action if not needed. {{ shadow_play }} is the core modifier here, with
    {{ shroud_of_absence }} and {{ shroud_of_night }} as useful additional stealth that costs no blood.
    {{ tenebrous_form }} is great against allies, preventing them to block since they have no blood to pay.
    Depending on the {{ meta }}, proportions can be adjusted and {{ blanket_of_night }} can be added for more denial.
</p>
<p>
    With {{ OBT }} on top of {{ govern_the_unaligned }} and {{ conditioning }}, the vampires consume blood fast.
    This means {{ badr_shadow_of_granada }} and {{ the_path_of_night }} are very useful since they spare a bit of blood.
    On top of that, the deck includes various ways of regenerating blood, like {{ jake_washington }} – who can also
    block a dangerous rush action – {{ the_coven }}, which also hinders rush and grinder decks overall,
    and of course {{ giants_blood }}. Hunting is not always possible: in case the predator has intercept,
    they will jump on this undirected action to disable a vampire if they can.
</p>
<p>
    {{ deflection }} and {{ delaying_tactics }} defend against bleed and votes,
    and the deck uses only a few {{ shadow_body }} for additional combat defense, but also as a deterrent
    against a predator blocking {{ nocturn }} recruitements: this is the only undirected action they can block if they
    have the means so you might want to avoid losing stealth on that.
    As a conclusion, {{ sudden_reversal }} is there to disable {{ bloat }} Master cards like {{ villein }} or
    {{ liquidation }} on your prey, or permanent intercept like {{ krcg_news_radio }}.
</p>
<h2>Tweaks and variants</h2>
<p>
    {{ the_unmasking }} is a common inclusion in this build, but it is not mandatory. The number of
    {{ nocturn }} can vary widely: in case of a combat-heavy meta, playing 12 or more is not unheard of.
    {{ zaire_river_ferry }} is another interesting option, since it provides both stealth and rush protection.
    Other equipments like {{ heart_of_nizchetus }} and {{ the_signet_of_king_saul }} can find their place here,
    as well as a {{ political_hunting_ground }}.
    Finally, if you have access to legacy cards, {{ the_admonitions }} is a good addition
    or replacement for {{ the_barrens }}.
</p>
<p>
    The {{ main_article }} about the archetype presents additional variants.
</p>
<h2>What to buy</h2>
<p>
    The bulk of the cards come from {{ print_on_demand }}, the {{ anniversary }} and the {{ parliament_of_shadows }}.
    {{ badr_shadow_of_granada }} is tricky to find in enough copies, but there's one in {{ anthology }} and they were 2
    in the <em>Danse Macabre</em> {{ kickstarter }} bundle, and you can replace him with other vampires from the
    {{ parliament_of_shadows }} or include some {{ anarch_convert }} for crypt management.
    {{ delaying_tactics }} and {{ sudden_reversal }} need to be sourced from other bundles or traded for.
</p>
<p>
    If you have access to legacy cards, {{ dame_hollerton }} is a great vampire here and
    would be a great replacement for {{ leila_monroe }}.
