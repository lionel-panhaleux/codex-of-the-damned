<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>powerbleed</em> deck starring {{ rebekka_chantry_elder_of_munich }}
    and {{ jost_werner }}. The deck uses the {{ PRE }}{{ AUS }} disciplines
    and the two star vampires have this nice permanent +1 stealth bonus
    that helps the deck get his actions through.
</p>
<p>
    {{ enchant_kindred }} is used to help get more vampires out in the game beginning,
    and bleed afterwards. {{ mind_numb }} can be used against the prey or the predator
    depending on the context, to slow them down.
</p>
<p>
    The deck uses no stealth apart from what the star vampires already have as an ability,
    but the combination of {{ mind_numb }} and {{ majesty }} makes it hard to block:
    {{ mind_numb }} can lock any defender and, if blocked, {{ majesty }} ends combat
    and unlock the acting vampire: the defender is still locked
    and a new action can be undertaken.
</p>
<p>
    The deck uses {{ anarch_troublemaker }} and {{ pentex_subversion }}
    to help paralyze the prey a bit more. When bleeds begin to get through,
    {{ aire_of_elation }} can be used to enhance them.
</p>
<p>
    If a bleed is bounced, it uses no stealth so it can usually be blocker by the grand-prey.
    The deck himself uses {{ AUS }} for wakes and bounces,
    so it can add the bleed power of its predator to its own.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ entrancement }} can help get rid of cumbersome allies,
    {{ scourge_of_the_enochians }} is there to deal with breed constructs.
</p>
<p>
    {{ delaying_tactics }} is the only defence available against stealth & vote builds:
    as {{ eyes_of_argus }} can not be used against undirected political actions,
    intercept can never go beyond 2.
</p>
<p>
    The deck plays a lot of bounces with {{ telepathic_misdirection }} and {{ my_enemy_s_enemy }}.
    They can also be used to block key actions on the opponents side.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    The <strong>Palla Grande</strong> variant uses a Toreador antitribu crypt,
    so it can use {{ palla_grande }} to increase the bleed power,
    like in {{ moises_ferrer_s_deck }} from 2018.
    {{ art_scam }} and {{ the_embrace }} are used to strengthen both the bloat and the pool damages.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Paolini-Detela</strong> variant uses
    {{ the_parthenon }} and {{ ashur_tablets }} to get a bit of recursion
    and help adapt the deck content to the table context.
    {{ martin_weinmayer_s_deck }} from the 2018 NAC Day 1 was an hommage to it.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Anson</strong> variant ditches {{ rebekka }} in favor of
    {{ anson }} to help play the {{ ashur_tablets }} with less copies of
    {{ the_parthenon }} and add {{ liquidation }} to the mix, like in
    {{ rudolf_scholz_s_deck }} from the 2012 Danish NC.
