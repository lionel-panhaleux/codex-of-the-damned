    {% trans trimmed %}
    V:tES has been played for years, and this has given birth to a number of efficient decks archetypes.
    Given the multiplayer nature of the game, many archetypes are valid choices at the highest level,
    as the efficiency of a deck depends a lot on its table placement and on the negociations skills of the player.
    Even on the modern tournament scene, dozens of different archetypes are usually played in a single event.
    {% endtrans %}
</p>
<p>
    {% trans trimmed %}
    As such, having a basic understanding of the most common archetypes and their strong and weak points is
    a very important skill for a player. Knowing the inner workings of the archetypes on the table is the only way
    to fathom the table balance and detect the opportunities as they arise during the game.
    {% endtrans %}
</p>
<p>
    {% trans trimmed %}
    The archetypes are usually divided into broader categories, as presented here.
    {% endtrans %}
</p>

<h2 id="bleed">{{ _("Bleed") }}</h2>
<p>
    {% trans trimmed %}
    Bleed decks are focused on prey aggression and use bleed actions to inflict heavy pool damages.
    {{ dom }} is without question the most damage-heavy bleed discipline, plus it does come with bounce cards.
    {{ pre }} and {{ dem }} are good second choices.
    {% endtrans %}
</p>
<h3>{{ _("Stealth & Bleed and Powerbleed") }}</h3>
<p>
    {% trans trimmed %}
    There are two ways to get bleeds through: using <strong>stealth</strong> is the most obvious one.
    {{ obf }} is the best stealth discipline, but it does not often come along with {{ dom }}.
    {{ obt }}, {{ obl }} and {{ pro }} come second.

    %}
    The other way to get bleeds through is to make sure the prey has no minion available to block the action.
    Along its strong bleed capabilities, {{ dom }} offers the excellent {{ seduction }}.
    {{ OBF }} {{ elder_impersonation }}, {{ NEC }} {{ call_of_the_hungry_dead }}, {{ OBL }} {{ stygian_shroud }}
    {{ for }} {{ daring_the_dawn }}, {{ salubri }} {{ forced_confessional }},
    and {{ pre }} {{ mind_numb }} are also effective tools.
    Combining these options with the few Master cards that can prevent block or lock minions —
    {{ pentex_subversion }}, {{ misdirection }} and {{ anarch_troublemaker }} —
    makes stealth and intercept irrelevant.

        Yet another possibility is to get the bleeds through by the sheer intimidation of a strong combat module.
        This strategy, called <em>Bruise & Bleed</em>, is never used all by itself. It's either coupled to a compact
        but efficient blocking module to form a toolbox, like in the {{ euro_brujah }} or {{ haqim_royalty }}
        decks, or to a swarm strategy like with {{ emerald_legion }} or some instances of {{ haqim_royalty }}.

        Simply put, trying to <em>Bruise & Bleed</em> is letting your opponents choose whether they block

        bring some adaptability through blocks, or put out an overwhelming swarm that cannot be out-bloated
        or simply bounced away.

<h3>{{ _("Highlights") }}</h3>
<p>
    {% trans trimmed %}
    Bleed decks have the <strong>highest prey damage</strong>. They tend to oust their first prey quite often,
    but it also attracts the table attention on them and one oust is not enough for a game win.
    They are usually <strong>weak in combat</strong>. They tend to rely on « combat ends » effects,
    but some flavours can have aggravated damage or torpor strikes as a threat.

<div class="insert tip">
    <h3>{{ _("Stealth rotation") }}</h3>
    <p>
        {% trans trimmed %}
        Stealth & Bleed archetypes have a strong stealth module, but it can jam the hand.
        If the prey assumes she will not have the means to block, she should decide not to attempt to block at all,
        and <strong>try to jam her predator hand on the stealth module</strong>.
        Well constructed Stealth & Bleed decks include some rotation tools to help with that.

    {% trans trimmed %}
    As they are focused on their prey, bleed decks have a weak defence against their predator

    either breed and find a way to give votes to all your vampires, or use older vampires with titles themselves.

    one has to display excellent table awareness and negotiation abilities.
    For the toolbox to have a proper effect around the table and display all its efficiency,
    one needs to <strong>play their hand</strong>, whatever is in it.
    The deck chooses the strategy as much as the Methusalah.
    The player still chooses on which target to use its cards,
    but the cards in hand demand to be played for the deck to shine.

        The {{ heart_of_nizchetus }} is often included in toolbox builds,
        as it gives more control to the Methusalah over what his play can be.
        Its effect makes such a difference in efficiency it has been nicknamed

    Finally, toolbox decks have <strong>strong defence</strong>, although not as strong as <em>wall</em> decks.
    They tend to have good intercept options and/or rush capabilities to handle their predator.
    Having much less offensive options than a vote or bleed deck, they cannot rely on pure speed to best their predator:
    they have to deter its actions actively using blocks, bounces or combats depending on the build.

    Rush decks use combat as their main weapon. Many disciplines have good combat options and
    they are also good combat cards with no discipline.
    Getting vampires down around the table is fun, but does not help so much to get the prey's pool down.
    To this effect, a handful of cards can help, namely
    {{ fame }}, {{ dragonbound }} and {{ tension_in_the_ranks }}.

<h3>{{ _("Highlights") }}</h3>

    {% trans trimmed %}
    The ability to take down any minion provide these decks with a <strong>strong defence</strong>
    against their predator. Depending on the predator archetype, going against its minions first
    is a common strategy for a rush deck: it may take some combats to get them down,
    but they can disable their predator very fast. On the other hand, they have
    a <strong>weak offence</strong> and have trouble finding a way to deliver pool damage to their prey.
    This is the core issue of the archetype.

        {% trans trimmed %}
        If they do not take down their prey very fast, rush decks have a unique control over the table balance
        as they can take down the minions of any Methusalah. Proper table control is
        essential to the succes of such builds, but it also opens a unique strategy for negociation:
        using the threat of combat to get things out of your neighbours.

<h3>{{ _("Highlights") }}</h3>
<p>
    {% trans trimmed %}
    Combo decks use complicated card combinations to a devastative effect. Their strength is in
    the <strong>absolute advantage</strong> their combination provides if all goes well. Their weakness
    is the frailty of such a combination. Blocking the right action or countering the right Master can often
    stop them dead in their tracks. Moreover, known combinations tend to attract the attention of all players,
    often leading the Methusalah to lose all its allies very early in the game.
