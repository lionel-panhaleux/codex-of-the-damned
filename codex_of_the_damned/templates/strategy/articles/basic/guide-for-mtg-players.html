    Some MTG players, especially those who favor the {{ commander_format }},
    make the switch to VTES. They broadly consider VTES to be a perfected version of what
    commander attempts to be: a fun multiplayer experience, laced with a lot of interactions
    and negociations between them. Considering both games have the same creator
    (Richard C. Garfield), there are also a lot of similarities: that makes VTES an easy
    candidate for MTG players. But there are also a number of differences and these end up
    leading to unexpect misconceptions that are hard to overcome for us MTG players.

    First thing, in VTES your life (pool) is also what you use to summon (influence)
    your vampires. So, in a sense everyone plays black. But, more simply put, even if
    you don't have to bother with lands, you have to have a real strategy about the
    {{ beads_economy }} here: how much will you invest in vampires and how much to keep for safety?
    It's obiously always better to invest more (more vampires, more actions, more power)
    but ideally you want to be just shy of getting ousted by your predator.

    {% trans trimmed
    the_lunge=link("/strategy/articles/basic/guide-for-mtg-players", _("the lunge"), _anchor="the-lunge")
    %}
    A large part of the game strategy actually revolves around that.
    If you're able to figure out how much you can be hurt by the rest of the table,
    you know how much you must keep in defense. And symmetrically, if your predator
    can somehow mess with your assessment and push you to underestimate them, they will have
    an easy grab for a Victory Point. This is what VTES players refer to as {{ the_lunge }}.
    Estimating precisely how much your predator can lunge for
    (the number of pool damage they can deliver) is key, as is obscuring this information
    on the predator's end.

<h2 id="cards-replacement">{{ _('Cards replacement') }}</h2>
<p>
    {% trans trimmed %}
    This is really the main difference: in MTG you get one new card per turn.
    Card management is a thing: <b>card advantage</b> is a core strategical concept.
    In VTES, you replace every card you play. There's not card advantage in the sense
    MTG players know of. So, what does that change?
    {% endtrans %}
</p>

<h3 id="play-your-cards">{{ _('Play your cards') }}</h3>
<p>
    {% trans trimmed %}
    Well, the first thing you will have to relearn is to play and discard your cards. As an MTG player, you will have an
    unreasonable tendency to stick to your cards and not want to play them until the perfect moment. You need to unlearn
    that. In VTES, <b>playing a card costs nothing</b>. If the effect it has even slightly advantages you, that's a net
    gain. You need to play all the cards you can all the time. At the end of a game, the more cards you played, the more
    chances you have to win: more cards played means more effects, which means more advantages, and that should put you in
    a dominant position.

</p>

<div class="insert tip">
    <h3 id="discard-every-turn">{{ _('Discard every turn') }}</h3>
    <p>
        {% trans trimmed percent="%" %}
        It's the same thing with dicarding at the end of a turn: not an easy thing at first but in fact, you need to
        discard often because, again, <b>it costs nothing</b>. If discarding a card has more chances to improve your
        hand that it has chances making it worse, you should discard. And 80{{ percent }} of the time, given you choose what you
        discard, the chance for improvement is big enough that you should.

    </p>
</div>

<h3 id="keep-the-right-cards">{{ _('Keep the right cards') }}</h3>
<p>
    {% trans trimmed percent="%" %}
    The other side of the medal is trickier. Once you've learn to play
    all the cards all the time and discard at every chance, you will need to relearn
    when not to do it.
    It largely depends on the deck and how it's built but some cards are supposed to be used
    liberally, others are supposed to be kept or discarded depending on the table situation.
    When not to discard is almost as tricky. You need to know your deck and assess the table
    well enough to notice when your chances for hand improvement are poor: you have a very
    decent hand and discarding anything in it might do more harm than good. This happens
    maybe 20{{ percent }} of the time.

        First, it's a good hand: you got a {{ govern }} and the stealth to make it through, and even a

        should go well. Now, what to discard? It is not a perfect hand and, even with the early {{ zillah }}, you got
        two discards until {{ stanislava }} acts. Not discarding here would be a mistake, because there are many
        possible improvement: any master would be a card to play next turn, where you still have no vampire. If you get
        {{ information_highway }}, another {{ zillah }}, or a {{dreams}}, it's a treat. More importantly, you need a
        {{ villein }} early, and you don't have it yet, so you should cycle.

        So, what to discard? The second {{ govern }} is a keeper: being able to play two {{ govern }} at superior in the
        first two turns is ideal. The stealth should be kept to secure those actions, and {{ form_of_mist }} can also be
        used to end a dangerous combat if someone rushes you just after you get out.
        So it has to be {{ parity_shift }}, {{ kine_resources }} or {{ on_the_qui_vive }}. {{ stanislava }} won't be
        able to play {{ parity_shift }} so you might think that's the one, but that would likely be a mistake: it
        will not be used immediately, but once {{ ingrid }} gets out, she should go for it immediately to get some pool
        back, especially if you did not draw a {{ villein }} by then. {{ on_the_qui_vive }} then? It is too precious:
        the deck does not run a lot of wakes and later on and combined with a {{ deflection }}, it will save you pool

        The conclusion is inevitable: {{ kine_resources }} has to go. {{ stanislava }} can bleed as a second action, or

    {% trans trimmed %}
    VTES is a smaller card pool than MTG. It holds 3900 cards and, sure, MTG standard (∼1500) has less, but it is
    renewed every year. Modern holds four time this amount (16K), not mentioning the popular Commander format (24K).
    But there is <b>no expansion block</b> in VTES, and <b>no limit in the number of copies</b> of a card you can put in a deck.
    This is a dramatic difference. It means some very powerful cards in the game can (and are) simply used in 10 or even
    20 copies in some decks.

<p>
    {% trans trimmed %}
    So you don't have a lot of similar cards with very close effects to just combine together for stability and, since
    there are no block nor cards limit, design teams learned that just editing "very close" cards in the end means that
    one is better than the other and makes it obsolete. When designing similar effects on cards, they need to figure out
    just enough of a difference to make both cards relevant in different situations.

        The lack of cards limit also makes thinning out a deck a different question. Because of the limit of 4 cards
        in MTG, the smaller your deck, the more stable your draw: you should make your deck as small as possible.
        In VTES, since there is no card limit, you can have the same stability in a 60 or a 90 cards deck.
        If you play 10 Govern the Unaligned in a 60 cards deck, playing 15 in a 90 cards deck gives you the same draw
        chance (with a tad more variance, yes, for you statisticians out there, but you get my point).

    You will hear this saying a lot in your first few games. And it's not the most natural thing when you come from
    MTG at first. All players on the table are your opponents and, in the end, only one will win, but <em>your</em> prey
    is on your left. And sure, it's obvious: 6 pool is always good to take and Victory Points are how you win. So of
    course ousting your prey is always good. Anything that hurts your prey is a good thing. Remembering it is vital:
    you're not there to be just or equalize the chances around the table, you're here to oust your prey.

    Defending is important too, of course, but because life is mana, the more the game goes, the less pool people have.
    There is a natural attrition mechanism at play here: minions cost pool, their cards cost blood, combat costs blood,

<h2 id="the-lunge">{{ _('The lunge') }}</h2>

<p>
    {% trans trimmed %}
    The lunge is the first tactic one needs to learn as an MTG player.
    Some MTG tactics have to do with tempo, but in a very different way, since it's more
    about card tempo.
    {% endtrans %}
</p>
<p>
    {% trans trimmed %}
    The lunge in VTES is all about "damage tempo". You want to keep your most damaging effects in hand for the
    exact right moment when they will bring your prey to zero. Consider you're playing a stealth bleed deck
    (one of the simplest archetype to go with): a beginner MTG player will often just deliver whatever they draw and go
    forward with it full power, trusting the deck to bring as much damage as fast as possible, while an experienced
    player will make sure the damage is progressively higher and the finishing move is overwhelming.

        This is a proper lunge. The last turn delivers superior damage suddenly.
        Again, if the two last actions are in a second turn, this sequence leaves the opponent at
        10 after having delivered 8: it is harder to asses how fast the oust can happen.
        Note players got access to the same cards, they just played them in a different order.
        {% endtrans %}

</div>
<p>
    {% trans trimmed %}
    This is an essential tactic in the game: if you deliver too much damage too soon without ousting your prey, you're
    making the game harder for you: your prey will invest less pool and will take a more defensive stance, but also
    the rest of the table will mark you as more of a risk and hinder your efforts.
    {% endtrans %}
</p>

<p>
    {% trans trimmed %}
    More importantly, putting your prey low in pool while failing to oust them is really a
    <b>signal for your predator</b> than it's time for them to lunge. In a position like that,
    if they manage to oust you, then you've served them their second victory point on a silver platter.
    So failing to lunge will not only push your prey to go very defensive, it will also offer such a golden opportunity
    to your predator that they will have to be as offensive as possible to try to profit from it. It's a dreadful
    situation to put yourself in.
    {% endtrans %}
</p>

<p>
    {% trans trimmed %}
    Lunging is difficult. The fact that life is mana makes the whole game that much tenser.
    You need to learn to pilot your deck so that it not only delivers the damage it needs to deliver but does it,
    as much as possible, in an overwhelming and categorical fashion. Keeping your prey on low pool without managing
    to oust them is a losing proposition.
    {% endtrans %}

<h2 id="cards-in-1-copy">{{ _('Cards in 1 copy') }}</h2>
<p>
    {% trans trimmed percent="%" %}
    Another difference is that in MTG you usually get to play 20{{ percent }} to 40{{ percent }} of your deck.
    The deck size lower limit is far higher than the number of cards you get to play.
    Not so in VTES: if you do not get ousted early, it's customary to play 60{{ percent }} to 80{{ percent }} of your deck,
    and deck sizes should be tailored with this objective in mind. If you tend to play a lot of cards,
    you'll go with an 80 or even a 90 cards deck. If the flow is slower, you should opt for 60 or 70 cards.

<p>
    {% trans trimmed %}
    You will often see decks fielding <b>cards in a single copy</b>, which for MTG is basically an heresy,
    since you are more likely to never draw a single-copy card in any given game. In VTES, with a well-built deck,
    you are likely to draw any single-copy card you put there in 2/3 of your games.
    So 1 copy is a good number for a silver bullet, although that means you need to keep it if it's relevant and

        Some single-copy inclusions are actually multiple copies in disguise: the different cards all serve the

        {{ bowl_of_convergence }}, {{ aranthebes }}, {{ mr_winthrop }}, and {{ krcg }}, all in a single copy.
        If one is better than the others, why not just play 2 or more copies of that one?
        Well, since you're drawing the majority of your deck in a game, it is better
        to get different unique cards you can stack than it is to get the best one sooner.
        All in all, <b>it matters more to be able to stack effects</b> and get a better setup than having an
        early impact. It is linked to the lunge tactic: the buildup is useful because stacking and damage tempo matter,

    This changes things. The way the game is designed, some vampires can deliver high bleed damage,
    others are excellent combatants and can deliver high damage to minions. But the two rarely go hand-in-hand.
    An {{ OBF }}{{ DOM }} vampire is a dangerous bleeder, but weak in combat, and a {{ POT }}{{ ANI }} vampire
    won't bleed much, but will be a dreadful combatant.

    And it's not just about strength. A high capacity vampire does not really have "more life", nor is it more robust. 
    A vampire's capacity does not matter if their opponent use aggravated damage like {{ claws_of_the_dead }}
    or just a {{ disarm }}. And, even if a high capacity vampire can take a big {{ roundhouse }} more easily, they
    do not regenerate between turns, so it's just a one-time thing. High capacity vampires bring more disciplines,
    titles and interesting special abilities. Their capacity is not toughness: ideally their blood should be recouped
    with a {{ villein }} to go back to the pool before they lose it.

    We started this article stating that "life is mana", but if you think about it, and even though you pay in pool for

        Because good combat vampires are often poor bleeders, but mostly because vampires are lands,
        <b>combat decks are not "aggro"</b>: they are control decks.
        Putting vampires in torpor slows down your opponents, destroying them is more akin to playing a good Armageddon:

        By destroying the vampires of your opponents, you slow or even shut them down.

        And it's not easy, because with combat-oriented vampires and cards, you will have poor

        Delicate planning and foresight are required to win this way. Despite the cards color,

    To be able to take any strategic decision, you will need to refine your ability to assess a table.
    Table assessment is the art of figuring out quickly who is playing what kind of deck, grasp the kind of resources
    they are likely to have, and deduce what their strengths and weaknesses are most likely to be.
    The opponents will whine and lie and try to manipulate you during the game: it's a big part of the game.

        The way a table <strong>folds</strong> is who gets ousted in which order: like an origami,

        Coming from MTG, a very fast-paced game where tempo is key, it's easy to fall in the trap of trying to go very
        hard and very fast on the left, on the prey. It can absolutely work, but there's a lot more to VTES than this
        and, on average, going too hard too fast on your prey is a losing proposition. Against experienced players,
        you'll leave so much breathing room to your future preys that they're actually more likely to win the game than
        you are.

        Getting good at predicting how a table folds is crucial: you want your strategy to take into account the way

        is a cornerstone of strategy, so much so that players will purposedly influence the fold itself to push the
