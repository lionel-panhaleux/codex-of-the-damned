    As soon as I started writing this article I realized that the topic is so broad and complex
    that it would take forever to explore all its facets.
    Thus, in this primer, I will focus on the basics and cover only the most common combat doctrines you can encounter,
    so no bloodline or niche discipline.

<h2>{{ _('Why and how to play combat?') }}</h2>
<p>
    {% trans trimmed %}
    The common misconception about combat among newer players is that combat is a goal in itself,
    focusing on eliminating minions and little else.
    This is a wrong approach, even though it can be fun to tear off limbs and see everything burn,
    at least for the one doing the tearing and burning, it does not bring you any closer to victory in and of itself.
    {% endtrans %}

<p>
    {% trans trimmed
    rush=link("/strategy/combat", _("rush"))
    %}
    When thinking about combat in VTES you must first and foremost think of it as a tool of control.
    No other type of deck can reach all across the table and control the distribution of resources.
    If someone (primarily your prey and predator) gets too strong at the table you can always visit them
    and take some of their blood for yourself, or reduce their headcount to slow them down.
    Most commonly, combat decks will make their predator the target of their first {{ rush }},
    to reduce pressure on their back and be able to focus all of their attention on their prey.
    {% endtrans %}
</p>
<p>
    {% trans trimmed %}
    It is of utmost importance to remember that combat is just a tool to help you win, not a win condition.
    When building a combat deck, you must think of how your deck will oust the prey first and foremost.
    Quite often fledgling combat aspirants forget about this
    and focus all of their efforts on sending vampires to torpor only to discover too late that
    then they have no way of reducing their pool fast enough: they get left behind in the race for victory points.

    Any dual-purpose cards that let you take pool or enter combat like {{ deep_song }} or {{ line_brawl }}
    are also very good additions since you will most likely need all the deck space you can get for efficient combat.
    Once you have solved the question of ousting power, you will also have to think about the challenges you might face.
    For combat decks, those typically boil down to:
    {% endtrans %}
</p>
<ul>
    <li>{% trans trimmed %}
        <strong>Maneuvers</strong>: if you fight at close range, you must be able to beat at least one maneuver.
        {% endtrans %}
    </li>
    <li>{% trans trimmed %}
        <strong>Dodge & Combat ends</strong>: nothing is more frustrating than having all your damage whiff so having an
        answer to that is top priority.
        {% endtrans %}
    </li>
    <li>{% trans trimmed %}
        <strong>Damage prevention</strong>: unfortunately outside of a few specialist choices there is very little you
        can do about it. Some presses can help to continue combat.
        {% endtrans %}
    </li>
    <li>{% trans trimmed %}
        <strong>Enemy combat</strong>: again, little you can do about it, a fight between two combat decks often boils
        down to a coin toss and there are just too many permutations to be ready for everything.

    <h3>{{ _('How to play against combat?') }}</h3>
    <p>
        {% trans trimmed %}
        Being on the receiving end of a combat deck is rarely fun, some even find it the worst experience in VTES that
        saps their will to play. Do not despair though as all is not lost even if you are being hurt badly, there are
        ways of dealing with combat that most decks can do. In general, you will want to make yourself an undesirable
        prey for the combat deck to discourage rushes. Combat decks have limited resources and spending them can be a
        tough decision. Here are some simple ways to stimmy the predations of a rush-happy deck:
        {% endtrans %}
    </p>
    <h4>{{ _('Delay') }}</h4>
    <p>
        {% trans trimmed %}
        In the beginning, if you know that your prey or predator is a combat deck, you can delay your start a bit to
        bring out 2 vampires at the same time. There is little direct threat to your pool early on from the combat deck,
        so delaying your start should not be a problem, whereas having more than one target now means they need to
        expend more actions to take you offline completely.
        {% endtrans %}
    </p>
    <h4>{{ _('Talk') }}</h4>
    <p>
        {% trans trimmed %}
        Talk to people. This is often the simplest but most forgotten way of dealing with combat. If you are being
        slaughtered just ask around the table for others to help rescue your vampires from torpor or — in case you are
        the predator of a combat deck and have been rushed to oblivion — slow down their advances toward you so you can
        rebuild and pose a threat to combat again. Most people should be happy to do so because this brings you back as
        the primary target and takes this burden off of them. At some point, a combat deck will run out of resources or
        decide to focus them elsewhere and let you play your game. Patience is a virtue.
        {% endtrans %}
    </p>
    <h4>{{ _('Rescue') }}</h4>
    <p>
        {% trans trimmed %}
        Rescue, rescue, rescue. Rescue your vampires, rescue other people vampires.
        It is a war of attrition after all and if you just do nothing you have already lost.
        {% endtrans %}
    </p>
    <h4>{{ _('Remove blood') }}</h4>
    <p>
        {% trans trimmed
        villein=card("Villein")
        %}
        Remove blood from your vampires. If you are facing combat and you know you cannot get away then make yourself a
        less desirable target. {{ Villein }} down your vampires as much as you can, this helps build your pool and also
        reduces the effectiveness of combat. If you do not have blood they cannot take it from you and they may
        overspend resources without need.
        {% endtrans %}
    </p>
    <h4>{{ _('Block') }}</h4>
    <p>
        {% trans trimmed
        embrace=card("The Embrace", "Embrace"),
        jake_washington=card("Jake Washington")
        %}
        Have some chump blockers. Small minions are typically undesirable targets for combat decks. Having to waste an
        action and potentially some combat cards to send an {{ embrace }} with no blood to torpor or fight
        {{ jake_washington }} is not something a combat deck wants to do. Smaller vampires can protect your more
        important ones.
        {% endtrans %}

    target_vitals=card("Target Vitals"),
    pulled_fangs=card("Pulled Fangs"),
    the_unmasking=card("The Unmasking")
    %}
    those decks typically bring allies to fight for them. The most common examples here would be {{ nephandus }},
    who can both bleed and fight as well as scary {{ war_ghoul }}. Those decks do not pack a very large combat package,
    but they are extremely efficient with it. {{ nephandus }} playing {{ trap }} does 5 damage while taking none itself
    (assuming fighting a vampire that does nothing in combat), {{ war_ghoul }} with {{ trap }} can do a whopping
    16 damage in one combat. They will sometimes also add low quantities of other combat cards that might help them
    dish out damage a bit faster or provide extra effects.
    {{ molotov_cocktail }}, {{ target_vitals }}, and {{ pulled_fangs }} are such cards.
    They will also use {{ the_unmasking }} to help protect their pool.
    {% endtrans %}
</p>
<h3>{{ _('Guns') }}</h3>

    {% trans trimmed

    magnum=card(".44 Magnum"),
    saturday_night_special=card("Saturday Night Special"),
    dragon_s_breath_rounds=card("Dragon’s Breath Rounds")
    %}
    Guns are used quite often because of the high efficiency they provide.
    Having a built-in maneuver and strike is extremely useful throughout the game.
    Everyone can use them and with the help of {{ concealed_weapon }}, you can equip them in combat
    and not risk getting your equip action blocked. The most common gun you will see is the {{ magnum }},
    but there are a few decks that run the cheaper {{ saturday_night_special }} in combination with
    {{ dragon_s_breath_rounds }}, sacrificing the long-term efficiency of guns for short-term bursts
    of aggravated damage at long range.
    {% endtrans %}
</p>
<h3>{{ _('Sticks') }}</h3>
<div class="column-2">{{ card_image("Weighted Walking Stick", false) }}</div>
<div class="column-2">{{ card_image("Target Vitals", false) }}</div>
<p>
    {% trans trimmed
    weighted_walking_stick=card("Weighted Walking Stick"),
    target_vitals=card("Target Vitals"),
    target_head=card("Target Head")
    %}
    Some decks do not use disciplines but like to fight anyway. If they are not using guns,
    they might be using {{ weighted_walking_stick }} for some extra damage and an assortment of aim cards to boost it.
    {{ target_vitals }}, {{ target_head }}, etc.
    {% endtrans %}
</p>

<h3>{{ani}} {{ _('Animalism') }}</h3>
<div class="column-2">{{ card_image("Aid From Bats", false) }}</div>

    carrion_crows=card("Carrion Crows"),
    canine_horde=card("Canine Horde"),
    voracious_vermin=card("Voracious Vermin"),
    terror_frenzy=card("Terror Frenzy"),
    drawing_out_the_beast=card("Drawing Out the Beast")
    %}
    Animalism {{ ani }} has long been one of the premier combat disciplines due to its efficiency.
    Deep Song provides both extra bleeding and a rush, {{ aid_from_bats }} provides damage coupled with
    maneuver <em>and</em> a press while {{ carrion_crows }} provides extra environmental damage.
    This is a very neat and easy-to-use combat package that also has access to some bonus effects
    like weapon destruction ({{ canine_horde }}, {{ voracious_vermin }}) or denying your opponent’s presses
    and maneuvers with {{ terror_frenzy }} or {{ drawing_out_the_beast }}. Its only downside is the lack of an answer to
    Combat Ends effects, making it unreliable when fighting against decks that have a lot of them.
    {% endtrans %}
</p>
<h3>{{cel}} {{ _('Celerity') }}</h3>
<div class="column-2">{{ card_image("Pursuit", false) }}</div>

<p>
    {% trans trimmed
    psyche=card("Psyche!"),
    magnum=card(".44 Magnum")
    %}
    Most commonly paired with guns but can also be used as a supplementary discipline for other types of combat.
    Best known for providing plenty of maneuvers, dodges, and additional strikes,
    letting you deal a lot of damage in a single round of combat.
    Also provides one of the best ways of dealing with Combat Ends in the form of {{ psyche }},
    which is also wonderful with {{ magnum }} as it resets the fight and thus allows you to use the maneuver
    from the gun again.
    {% endtrans %}
</p>
<h3>{{for}} {{ _('Fortitude') }}</h3>
<div class="column-2">{{ card_image("Rolling with the Punches", false) }}</div>
<div class="column-2">{{ card_image("Hidden Strength", false) }}</div>
<p>
    {% trans trimmed
    freak_drive=card("Freak Drive")
    %}
    Not much to say here. Having access to damage prevention is always good in combat.
    Additionally, it provides decks with {{ freak_drive }} for multi-acting so you can either rush multiple times
    in a single turn or do a combination of rushing and bleeding.
    {% endtrans %}
</p>
<h3>{{pot}} {{ _('Potence') }}</h3>
<div class="column-2">{{ card_image("Roundhouse", false) }}</div>
<div class="column-2">{{ card_image("Immortal Grapple", false) }}</div>
<p>
    {% trans trimmed
    torn_signpost=card("Torn Signpost"),
    roundhouse=card("Roundhouse"),
    immortal_grapple=card("Immortal Grapple"),
    disarm=card("Disarm"),
    decapitate=card("Decapitate")
    %}
    This is <em>the</em> combat discipline, seeing how there are very few cards for it outside of combat cards.
    Being able to do high damage thanks to cards like {{ torn_signpost }} and {{ roundhouse }},
    dealing with dodges and combat ends thanks to {{ immortal_grapple }} as well as sending people straight to torpor
    with {{ disarm }} or burning them outright with {{ decapitate }}. It does not come without its downsides though.
    Most of it only works at close range with very few options for maneuvering,
    and it also puts your vampire at risk of getting hit back.
    {% endtrans %}
</p>
<h3>{{tha}} {{ _('Blood Sorcery') }}</h3>
<div class="column-2">{{ card_image("Theft of Vitae", false) }}</div>
<div class="column-2">{{ card_image("Rego Motum", false) }}</div>
<p>
    {% trans trimmed
    theft_of_vitae=card("Theft of Vitae"),
    apportation=card("Apportation"),
    rego_motum=card("Rego Motum"),
    walk_of_flame=card("Walk of Flame")
    %}
    Pretty light combat but worth mentioning. Famously used for life-stealing effects which bypass damage prevention
    and help you come out on top with resources thanks to cards like {{ theft_of_vitae }},
    as well as access to maneuvers thanks to {{ apportation }}, limited damage prevention with {{ rego_motum }},
    and aggravated damage like {{ walk_of_flame }}. Thaumaturgy is not known for being a scary combat,
    but it definitely can pose trouble for some decks and help ensure you are pulling ahead.
