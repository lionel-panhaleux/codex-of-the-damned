    Neonates are the new Methuselah joining us in the Eternal Struggle.
    If you're looking into getting in the game, your best bet is without question
    the {{ v5_box }}, containing 5 Camarilla preconstructed decks:
    Ventrue {{ ventrue }}, Tremere {{ tremere }}, Toreador {{ toreador }}, Nosferatu {{ nosferatu }}
    and Malkavian {{ malkavian }}. You can play them straight out of the box and get a few fun games out of them.
    It is the perfect start for a collection or a curious Coterie alike.

    If you're more interested into demoing the game, you might want to acquire instead the
    five {{ new_blood }} decks matching those clans: they're cheaper and they're perfect to
    demonstrate how the game works to a couple of people in half an hour, but they're not
    full-fledged decks you can run a real game with. However, they are perfect additions
    to the V5 decks: you can use the New Blood cards to tinker the starter decks and
    try to modify and improve them a bit.

    If you want to go beyond that and achieve the highest power possible for the lowest
    price, it seems like a good rule of thumb is to go <strong>one V5 starter + two New Blood</strong> for
    each clan. See for example these blog articles about {{ tremere }} and {{ malkavian }}.

    Your other options is to have fun with a bit more deck building. Rather than

    friends to come play with, maybe you're more into carefully honing and improving your
    own deck and then meet with your friends and there deck to see who comes out on top.
    Maybe you want to play regularly with Elders who have access to a wider collection,
    or participate in tournaments.

<p>
    {% trans trimmed %}

    <h3>{{ _('Upcoming V5 format') }}</h3>
    <p>
        {% trans trimmed %}
        Note that the VEKN Inner Circle did announce that a "V5 format" will probably
        be defined in 2023. There is no precise list yet of what we can expect as part of it,
        but most likely all products listed as V5 on the BCP website and online shop will
        probably be part of it, whereas legacy products and print on demand reprints
        will be excluded of it. Promo vampires starting with the promo pack 2 will
        likely be part of it, while the few reprints in those promo packs might not.
        {% endtrans %}
    </p>
    <p>
        {% trans trimmed %}
        So, if you're mostly interested in the new format, you might want to stay away
        from the legacy products. On the other hand, note that it is unlikely that this
        new format will be come the "new standard" anytime soon: while some events
        might use it to appeal to more neonates, the biggest (nationals and continentals)
        and many playgroups will continue using all cards.
        {% endtrans %}
    </p>
    <p>
        {% trans trimmed %}
        Contrarily to other CCGs, the more times goes by, the more reprints get available
        for all the old cards with the print on demand system, so new joiners will face
        less and less difficulties acquiring all the cards they need. The new "V5 format"
        could become mainstream in a few years, but it might just as well die out early.
        Right now, with the format not even completely defined, there's no way to know.

        high capacity avenues for the Ventrue {{ ventrue }}, {{ daria }} with her superior {{ AUS }} can open new

        tournament decks so strong the meta had to adapt and include more solutions against
        the typical swarm of allies these decks can field. So much so that the card was errated in February 2024,
        making Emerald decks much less of a thing, and acquiring this bundle less appealing.

        The other {{ legacy_preconstructed_decks }} were released as high level preconstructed decks to allow neonates
        to join existing Elder tables with something decent enough to leave them a chance.
        To make it worth our while, BCP also seized this occasion to print rather heavily
        sought-after cards, like a bunch of {{ antonio }} and {{ nephandus }} in {{ pact_with_nephandi }},
        so many {{ embraces }} alongside a couple of {{ palla_grande }} and {{ foundation_exhibit }} in {{ libertine_ball }},
        the whole Lasombra {{ lasombra }} package together with {{ jake_washington }} and {{ monastery_of_shadows }}
        in {{ parliament_of_shadows }}, and the whole {{ aus }} package with {{ the_rack }}, {{ smiling_jack }},
        {{ bowl_of_convergence }} and {{ heart_of_nizchetus }} in {{ den_of_fiends }}.

    A few of us Elders are greedy hoarders. That's fine, that's the beast speaking, really.
    You have to let it go from time to time, right? Some pretty {{ exclusive_promos }} have been
    released in the last few years, and there have been successive prints and differences
    in bundles you might want to know about:
    {% endtrans %}
</p>
<ul>
    {% trans trimmed %}
    <li>
        Some promos have been released with alternate are: <strong>Full-bleed</strong> Maila, G6 Theo Bell and
        Hesha Ruhadze, two <strong>sketch versions</strong> of Direct Intervention, <strong>alternate arts</strong>
        for Archon Investigation and Bum's Rush.
    </li>
    <li>
        An <strong>Edge card</strong> that has been released as promo and is now also available as print-on-demand.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <strong>Anthology set</strong> released and sold in Berlin in 2017 is different from the Anthology 1
        reprint: it had a few more cards (Andre, Aisha, The Line) and a different icon.
    </li>
    <li>
        The pledgers of the <strong>Unleashed Kickstarter</strong>, the printed release of the VEKN "PDF expansions"
        Anarch Unbound, Danse Macabre and The Unaligned, also got the promos Double Deuce, Ashlesha, Len Kanopka,
        Vivienne Geroux, City Star Taxi, Dark Web Procurer and Vlad Tepes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Promos have <strong>no icon</strong>, the reprints do. So there are multiple versions of the cards
        in the promo packs or on print-on-demand (All cards in promo packs 1 and 2 were first released as promos with no
        icon, as was Nefertiti advanced or Anarch Convert, for example). The cards that have been promos multiple time,
        like Entrancement and Charisma had no icon the first time, and a <strong>specific GP icon</strong>
        (different for each) for the second promo round.
    </li>
    <li>
        They were exclusive promos for some <strong>World of Darkness product</strong>:
        Bolesław Gutowski (Polish edition of VTM, released), Alicia Cortez (Mind's Eye Theatre, released),
        Gabriel Tremblay (Chapters, released) and Tegyrius (War of Ages, unreleased yet).
    </li>
    <li>
        V5 bundles have been release not only in English, but also in <strong>French</strong>, <strong>Spanish</strong>
        and <strong>Protuguese</strong>. Some bundles were also release in <strong>Latin</strong>. These might make for
        nice alternates in your decks, or constitute an additional challenge if you're a real completionist.
