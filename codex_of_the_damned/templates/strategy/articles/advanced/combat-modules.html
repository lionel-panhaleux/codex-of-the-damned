    A common trip down the rabbit hole, for any new player who starts to dig in VTES,
    is to spend a couple of years diving into the intricacies of combat to try to figure out
    the most efficient and guaranteed way to dispose of the opponents vampires.
    {% endtrans %}

    {% trans trimmed

    Let's face it: combat is fun, and at least if you have a solid combat deck,
    you will probably manage to stay in the game a bit longer. As explained in the
    {{ combat_primer }} article though, one needs to approach combat with a bit of caution:
    blowing things up is fun, but combat is ultimately about control. Winning with combat
    is hard, and prevailing on a table necessitates a good understanding of what works and what
    does not.
    {% endtrans %}
</p>
<p>
    {% trans trimmed %}
    We will go through all known combat modules that have proved their efficiency by winning at least some tournaments,
    which will give us a good picture of what works and what does not. No combat module beats everything else.
    Players have tried for 30 years, and the ultimate combination does not exist.
    But some are definitely stronger than others but more importantly, if you want to get good at combat,
    you need to know what your module strengths and weaknesses, but also what your opponents modules can or cannot do.

        There are two combat styles, not counting the defensive posture where you just try to avoid combat through
        <strong>S</strong>trike: <strong>C</strong>ombat <strong>E</strong>nds (SCE), dodges or prevention.
        Either you aim to {{ rush }} opposing minions and disable them,
        or you adopt a less explosive but sturdier approach and {{ block }} them.
        {% endtrans %}
    </p>
    <p>
        {% trans trimmed %}
        Combat decks are all about control: you aim to disable opposing vampires and control the table fold.
        Rush decks can exert control cross-table, which can be key to victory, but they have shakier control on their
        neighbors. Block decks on the other hand tend to exert higher pressure on their neighbors, and less control
        cross-table.
        {% endtrans %}
    </p>
    <p>
        {% trans trimmed %}
        But the differences cut deeper when it comes down to the combat module itself. Rush decks need to make sure
        their rush actions produce results, so they need solid solutions against Combat Ends and other defenses.
        On the other end, block decks already provide a good deal of their control effect just by blocking successfuly.
        Disabling the blocked minion, or even just grinding some beads off them, is just a bonus. Which is just as well:
        you need a bigger module for a rush deck, to have higher efficiency against combat defenses, and a lighter
        module for a block deck, to leave more room for reactions: you won't block without good wake and intercept
        capabilities.
        {% endtrans %}
    </p>
    <p>
        {% trans trimmed %}
        Of course, it is also spectrum: some rush decks have light block capabilities, and some block decks have a few
        rushes just in case. And anything in between.

    Animalism {{ ani }} is a prominent combat discipline. It is mainly due to {{ carrion_crows }}.
    It is an additional 2 beads every round, at any range. That can amount to a lot if you manage to get some presses.
    Being environmental damage, it is undodgeable, and as it is not a strike, high profile prevention cards like
    {{ rolling_with_the_punches }} and {{ rego_motum }} just won't work against it.
    Add some {{ taste_of_vitae }} to the mix and you can even keep a steady blood reserve floating around.
    All in all, the card gave birth to a dozen different combat modules.

    The most straightforward Animalism {{ ani }} module couples {{ carrion_crows }} with {{ aid_from_bats }}.
    It offers a 3 beads differential at no cost, with just 2 cards. It can also deliver any amount of damage
    by continuing to press and deliver 3 damage per round as long as it has more {{ aid_from_bats }}.
    On top of that, {{ terror_frenzy }} can be used to secure the long range, and {{ voracious_vermin }}

    {{ cat_s_guidance }}, not forgetting {{ army_of_rats }} as a bit of payload if you are going wall.
    There are additional, less widespread, tools, like {{ underbridge_stray }} that provide either a press or an unlock,

    Potence {{ pot }} is the other main combat discipline. And here, too, it is mostly due to a single card:
    {{ immortal_grapple }}. It is the only card in the game that altogether negates defensive effects like dodge and
    strike: combat ends, but also a lot of nasty surprises like torpor strikes ({{ coma }}, {{ entombment }}) or
    weapons. All the other anti-defensive tools, be it combat continuance like {{ psyche }} or direct cancellation like
    {{ death_seeker }}, only cancel the defense, so it is a battle of numbers. Not so with {{ ig }} (its nickname): if
    you get it in, you are guaranteed to land your strike. And for rush decks, it matters <strong>a lot</strong>.

    Of course, {{ ig }} is only usable at close range, so range management is useful, and then you need your strike
    to matter. But that's something Potence {{ pot }} provides with the strongest strikes in the game, mainly through
    {{ torn_signpost }}, {{ roundhouse }} and {{ preternatural_strength }}. Add some {{ taste_of_vitae }} to the mix and
    you can even keep a steady blood reserve floating around. On top of that, the second biggest staple
    of Potence {{ pot }}, also at close range, is {{ disarm }}. It is already strong in the discipline itself,
    but it really shines when paired with other disciplines: whether you manage to prevent or get an additional strike,
    it can send the opponent to torpor without even having to get more damage.

    usually rely on {{ sce }}. The lack of prevention can be issue, so if not coupled with prevention, a {{
    glancing_blow

    or two can prove useful. Lastly, Potence {{ POT }} also offers the terrifying {{ decapitate }},

    Contrarily to <a href="#animalism">Animalism</a>, the Potence {{ pot }} base module is still pretty decent

    Obtenebration all by itself offers surprisingly good lightweight combat options,
    with {{ arms_of_the_abyss }} and {{ entombment }}.
    A bit expensive at first glance, but a good base that is alrady a decent dissuasive module.
    It can be supplemented by a few {{ shadow_step }} and/or {{ amaranth }} for higher aggression, or lean on the
    defensive side, centered on or combined with the excellent

    {{ carrion_crows }} with {{ theft_of_vitae }} makes for a 6 beads differential. Add {{ rego_motum }} for prevention,

    Welcome to one of the best combat modules there is. Using {{ hunger_of_marduk }}, Banu Haqim {{ banu_haqim }}
    work around prevention in quick order and use Celerity {{ CEL }} additionals like {{ pursuit }},
    {{ quickness }} and {{ blur }} to empty their target. Between {{ pursuit }}, {{ swallowed_by_the_night }},
    and {{ resist_earth_s_grasp }}, they get excellent range management.
    And {{ rego_motum }} and {{ sideslip }} can provide prevention while {{ psyche }} helps counter defenses.
    Sure, they need to do an actual damage to dispose of the opponent, but they have access to Anti-Fortitude {{ for }}
    tech even there with {{ soul_burn }} or {{ blood_rage }}, or they can just hit for one, or use a {{ zip_gun }} or a
    {{ stick }}, or even a {{ walk_of_flame }} to burn their opponent if it is after a press.

    Ultimately, the only weakness is the limited prevention and the difficulty to handle defenses,
    since {{ psyche }} does not combine well with {{ hunger_of_marduk }}.
    That said, {{ hunter_s_mark }} provide a solid alternative against strong defenses, as long as there's enough
    stealth to land it consistantly. On top of it all, the module can occupy more than the usual density in a deck,
    thanks to {{ haqim_s_law_retribution }} that allows to transform all those red cards into bleed enhancers.
