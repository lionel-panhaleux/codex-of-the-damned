    Of course, there have been Baltimore Purge decks before the appearance of {{ montano }}, e.g. with {{ arika }},
    {{ stanislava }} or {{ ambrosio_luis_monçada }} as star vampires, but in comparison {{ montano }} offers
    better options: he is a Lasombra {{ lasombra }}, an 11 cap vampire, he pays one less for
    Obtenebration {{ obt }} cards and, probably most importantly, can burn 1 blood to give any of his controller’s
    minions +1 stealth; plus he has superior Dominate {{ DOM }} and Fortitude {{ FOR }}.
    This makes {{ montano }} the perfect engine for abusing {{ baltimore_purge }}, {{ graverobbing }}
    and {{ mind_rape }}. Since he has access to {{ freak_drive }}, he is able to pull off each of these cards himself
    in just one turn, and maybe even more effects, e.g. a superior {{ govern_the_unaligned }},
    a bleed for {{ enkil_cog }} or a vote. It is a blood-thirsty engine, which I personally prefer to feed
    with the help of {{ heidelberg_castle }} and diablerie.

        In my opinion, it is quite important to make {{ montano }} enter the ready region in round 2 of a game:
        The fewer the number of enemies’ minions, the less they can act or react.
        You hope to get some kind of setup done before actually starting the « show ».
        To achieve this you have to rely on a high number of crypt acceleration cards, especially on
        {{ zillah_s_valley }}.
        Yet a deck with a high number of Master cards that wants to play a lot of action cards and modifiers
        tends to encounter problems regarding the card flow. This is why I try to get {{ montano }} equipped
        with a {{ learjet }} as soon as possible.

    Okay, this tremendous « (try to) rule the world » deck is regularly the focus of all players at the table.
    {{ nocturns }} help to guard {{ montano }}, and a few {{ deflections }} might keep at least the heaviest bleeds
    away from you. Usually, you have to be very fast with doing what you want to do, or an evil fate awaits you
    instead of your opponents.

    Here is the list of the deck that won me the <em>Don’t Cry for Pentex</em> Lackey League Finals in 2019.
    I won’t discuss here whether specific cards miss or the numbers of specific cards are optimized.
    A lot of that depends on taste and the metagame. This deck is both fragile and very powerful,
    and it is definitely <strong>not a deck for beginners</strong>. It is especially weak against (stealth) rush decks,
    because you run a non-combat star vampire deck, or any kind of weenie deck,
    since you cannot control large numbers of vampires via {{ baltimore_purge }}.
    It helps a lot if there are slow decks with big and « tasty » vampires around, but the deck can be resilient enough
    to stop a Predator’s Dementation {{ dem }} bleed deck dead in its tracks.
    {% endtrans %}
</p>
<h2>{{ _('Table Talk') }}</h2>
<p>
    {% trans trimmed %}
    Obviously, it makes a difference if someone knows about your deck’s archetype and thus about its evil intentions.
    You should always try to talk if necessary, since there will be other decks as evil as yours at the table,
    and the mark of being the table threat is a matter of perception. Don’t boss around.
    {% endtrans %}
</p>
<p>
    {% trans trimmed baltimore_purge=card("Baltimore Purge") %}
    In case someone tries to interact with you, do so, if it makes at least some sense.
    If you play your first {{ baltimore_purge }}, cross-table buddies will ask if you are going to harm their vampires
    even more or they might even ask for a torpor rescue. Usually you have to decline both,
    since you do not have spare action, but you could generously leave them the choice of which vampire will be
    torporised by the {{ baltimore_purge }} if they controlled more than one vampire.
    Having a friend at the table or non-hostile cross-table buddies will make a huge difference.
    Depending on the vampires your buddies play, you might have to go for them anyway.
    {% endtrans %}
</p>
<p>
    {% trans trimmed %}
    Later in the game, when your deck has already done some damage to the table, try to make sure the literal card house
    falls apart in your favour. Encourage players to resist their predators even though their situation looks helpless.
    Offer them half or full VP, and stick to that deal if you can. I know that some players oppose withdrawal deals,
    but bear in mind that many of them are tournament legal, for example if you will have 3 VP,
    you can do whatever you want with the rest. Some players might try to threaten you by announcing to self-oust
    if you do or do not do this or that. You should ignore this posture in general.

    %}
    Maybe Montano Baltimore Purge (MBP) can be compared to a rush deck,
    combined with the high risk, high reward component of a Baali {{ baali }} bleed or vote deck.
    You have to decide where and when to play {{ mind_rape }} and {{ baltimore_purge }}.
    You are going to offset the table balance, and you want to make sure you don’t
    get ousted and that any threat to {{ montano }} is eliminated.

    aurora_van_brande=card("Aurora Van Brande, Paladin", "Aurora Van Brande"),
    baltimore_purge=card("Baltimore Purge"),
    mind_rape=card("Mind Rape")
    %}
    A nice setup to start the « show » is {{ montano }} with a {{ learjet }} and a midcap assistant
    ({{ aurora_van_brande }} is very nice, since she has superior Obtenebration {{ OBT }} and both Dominate {{ dom }}
    and Fortitude {{ for }}). Try to get through both a {{ baltimore_purge }} and a {{ mind_rape }} on a player
    who already controls 2 (!) vampires, preferably your Prey or your Predator, thus the mind raped vampire
    can diablerise someone and burn by the mandatory bloodhunt, which eliminates two vampires.
    {% endtrans %}
</p>
<p>
    {% trans trimmed learjet=card("Learjet")%}
    Always remember to use the {{ learjet }} if you have any cards in hand that do not help you in achieving your goals.
    But do not use it just because you can, because then you will run out of cards before you make the GW.
    Usually, you don’t get all of the table's VPs, but you don’t have to in order to win.

    %}
    This is a typical scenario: In your unlock phase {{ montano }} goes to torpor,
    and so will every other vampire in the game of your choosing (well, one per player).
    If you were able to put a second {{ baltimore_purge }} on {{ montano }} with the help of an
    out-of-turn action provided by {{ enkil_cog }}, the table might already be at your disposal.
    Now everything depends a bit on whether you have a {{ heidelberg_castle }} in play and if you have
    {{ freak_drive }} and {{ graverobbing }} in hand.

            Diablerize as many vampires as you can, or steal them with {{ graverobbing }}.
            The vampire with {{ mind_rape }} should preferably die during a bloodhunt referendum, and if it is a
            vampire with Fortitude {{ for }}, he might even bring more destruction to your opponents before doing so.

            Cards you should <strong>never discard</strong> unless you are sure about the other decks at the table:
            {{ shadow_body }} (Combat Ends), {{ deflection }} (against bleeds) and {{ nocturn }}
            (against rushes and bounced bleeds).

        </li>
        <li>
            The timing of the additional action with {{ enkil_cog }} can be tricky:
            if being unlocked makes {{ montano }} a target, let him act in your Prey’s turn.
            The same is true if another vampire at the table might play and contest {{ enkil_cog }} himself,
            which might spoil the whole game for you. If you can afford it and want to keep people guessing
            what your additional action might be, wait until the end of your Predator’s turn –
            but remember that he or she might take actions afterwards. And bear in mind that you could play
            {{ sudden_reversal }} on a {{ direct_intervention }} while acting out of turn.

    Gaining pool is one of the bigger issues of MBP, which is why some players add {{ golconda }} or {{ villein }}
    to their {{ montano }} deck. {{ govern }} down is highly recommended, and an {{ ancient_influence }}
    might make your day, especially when your prey has no more ready vampire. {{ reins_of_power }}
    is seen here and there, but {{ political_stranglehold }} looks more reliable. Ousting your first prey
    is highly recommended. Always be on guard: a bleed bounced to you or a {{ mind_numb }} on {{ montano }} could
    already be fatal.

        I need pool, but no pool gain is in sight yet, and I am accordingly worried about being bled
        by direct bleeds or bounces. I can play {{ enkil_cog }}, {{ the_signet_of_king_saul }} and {{ learjet }},
        then the machinery stops again. {{ la_viuda }} has to leave her blood to {{ montano }}.
        A {{ nocturn }} and {{ kassiym }} make up the defense. I am at 7 pool.
        {{ heart_of_nizchetus }} for Martin. Diogo plays {{ mind_numb }} on {{ johannes_castelein }} (lucky me),
        bleeds and continues to build up. Hellgie brings {{ mustafa_the_heir }} into play.
        I hardly remember the details of the 5th round. {{ the_capuchin }} appears, with Martin a third {{ AUS }} Weenie
        and {{ channel_10 }} (that can become something ...), Diogo comes on 4 vampires
        and plays {{ mind_numb }} on {{ mustafa }}. Hellgie cannot do much.

        {{ freak_drive }}. Afterwards, {{ capuchin }} bleeds (on Martin's suggestion that he should not hand
        {{ capuchin }} over to me unlocked in the case of {{ graverobbing }}), the bleed
        gets bounced to me by {{ my_enemy_s_enemy }} (well, great ...). Fortunately, I have a {{ deflection }} at hand.
        No block, bleed for 3 thanks to {{ bonding }}. Bounce to Diogo, and now the big question:
        to whom will he bounce? To Hellgie, who is then on 3 pool. Diogo ousts Hellgie in his turn
        which takes {{ anarch_troublemaker }} out of the game.

        Without hurry I oust Slaven two or three rounds later. Diogo shows spirit and continues to play full forward,
        which grants me a new and shiny {{ gracis }} via {{ graverobbing }}.
        Of course I try to oust Martin, but he bounces twice and eliminates Diogo.
        German-German heads up. I have no library left, and there are still 30 minutes left on the clock.

        I have 5 vampires, {{ montano }}, {{ kassiym }} and {{ ignacio }} as well as {{ capuchin }} and {{ gracis }},
        the big ones also with a lot of blood. And yet I'm afraid I'll run into the wall now:
        3 Auspex-Weenies supported by {{ channel_10 }} and also {{ krcg_news_radio }}, and be "shot down"
        by guns or aggravated damage and lose the game.
        But it turns out differently, the fights are only "Hand Strike, one". So it's a constant race,
        a struggle for Edge and {{ the_rack }}, also changes {{ the_coven }} happy back and forth.
        Finally, a bleed for 3 by {{ montano }} ends the game,
        as the last blocker is overcome thanks to a {{ blanket_of_night }} by {{ kassiym }}.

    As you can see, I was lucky enough to be able to act with {{ montano }} from turn 3,
    despite the fact I was the starting player, but could not take much advantage of it.
    I could have been ousted by turn 5 or 6 when my Predator would have been able to take actions
    or to bounce the bleeds of his Predator to me. This is why I decided to play {{ mind_rape }}
    on my Predator’s unlocked vampire.

    Turn 7 is a description of a typical turn when all the moving parts happen in the right order.
    Such a turn might take up to 20 or even 30 minutes, because of all the choices to make,
    especially using {{ learjet }} or not, and the actions to take.
    Afterwards the table balance should have taken a massive shift to your favour, but usually you will need another
    turn with {{ baltimore_purge }} and {{ graverobbing }} and diableries to assure your victory.
    If you can pull off a double Purge with the help of {{ enkil_cog }}, it is usually game over.

    If you do not feel the need for speed to let {{ montano }} enter the game by the end of round 2,
    you get space in the Master cards section. {{ villein }} or {{ golconda }}, {{ direct_intervention }}
    or {{ dark_influence }}, and {{ monastery_of_shadows }} or {{ elysian_fields }} are tempting options.
    Even {{ the_coven }} might be beneficial, since you want to have blood on the vampires {{ montano }} diablerises.

    You might want to play more than 5 copies of {{ baltimore_purge }}. Regarding Political Actions, adding another
    {{ banishment }} looks good. {{ reins_of_power }} is double-edged if you do not manage to have your predators
    big vamps in torpor. {{ political_stranglehold }} would interact nicely with {{ mind_rape }}.

    {{ zaire_river_ferry }} is a suggestion by famous <em>Martin Schuhmacher</em> I have not given a try so far.
    Reaction cards like {{ obedience }}, {{ on_the_qui_vive }} and more {{ deflections }} can come in handy
    depending on the situation.

    I consider Montano Baltimore Purge (MBP) to be a viable deck choice for larger tournaments, since you usually
    encounter a wider spread of decks and more decks which build up a few rounds.
    Big vampires are the “fish” you catch best, even wall stars since they are helpless once in torpor.
    I made especially good experiences with {{ the_capuchin }} played by my Prey.
    The more combat you expect, the less MBP becomes appealing if you are looking for a somehow safe road to success.
