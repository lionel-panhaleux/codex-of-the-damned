    I have never been much of a deck builder but I've always greatly enjoyed playing. When I was younger, I used
    considerably more time on this hobby by tinkering with decks of my own. However, I didn't do particularly well with
    my own designs. That's why these days, I practically always play decks created by way more talented deck builders
    than myself, only fine-tuning them to better fit my hand.

    This particular deck won the Tour de Chauffe tournament for <em>Martin Weinmayer</em> in 2019. I have used it in
    multiple tournaments and occasionally made slight adjustments based on the metagame. My best results with this deck
    are the final of EC 2019 and winning the Garou Rim: Antediluvian Awakening tournament.

        <p>
            {% trans trimmed %}
            I consider one of the most important lessons of V:TES I've learnt along the years to be:
            <strong>always play for the GW, not for the VP</strong>. This is especially true for combat decks such as
            this one that aim at controlling the table instead of quickly reducing pool. This principle will
            occasionally lead you to miss out on a VP that you would have gotten had you gone for it. This is a small
            price to pay for winning tables more often than if you were simply trying to get one VP after another.
            {% endtrans %}
        </p>
        <p>
            {% trans trimmed %}
            With this deck, your goal is to get 1 GW and from 2.5 to 4 VP. 1GW5 is certainly fine as well, but there's
            no point in forcing it. As long as 1 or 2 players are out of the game fast enough, you can typically be
            happy with the situation, even if it wasn't you who eliminated them. What does this mean in practice when
            playing this deck?

                        Is the survival of one of these decks particularly detrimental to your game plan? Do you have to
                        react to this deck already at an early stage, even when the player in question is not sitting
                        next to you? A good example is a {{ clown_car }} sitting cross table and not receiving proper
                        pressure.

                {% trans trimmed %}
                At the early stages, plan how to eliminate two "extra" players. If needed, help your crosstable buddy to
                eliminate their prey, especially if you get something in return. Be open to all kinds of deals in
                general. This deck's power increases dramatically the fewer players are left at the table. But always be
                ready to reassess the situation.

                Weakening your own predator is a good early game strategy with this deck. Even though your vampires are
                cheap, you're going to invest some pool in them and {{ nephandi }} practically every turn.
                {% endtrans %}
            </li>
        </ul>
        {% trans trimmed %}
        In the final, the deck's winning strategy remains the same as in the early rounds: getting rid of the "extra"
        players
        and thereafter taking control of the rest of the table. If the situation allows it, you'll want to contribute to
        eliminating seeds higher than yourself. This improves your chances to win even if you fail to take the remaining
        three VPs. Even a 2/2/1 VP split is enough as long as your seed is high enough.

    them because they can't do anything without a Tremere antitribu {{ tremere_antitribu }} in this deck.

            {{ tupdogs }}. Just keep in mind that it is important to have those {{ nephandus }} to destroy torpored
            vampires.

    In V:TES, one of the most important qualities of a deck is good card flow. Without it, your hand stagnates easily
    and both the deck's power and your play options drop dramatically. In this deck, the large master module (~35% of
    the deck) poses the greatest single hand jam risk. That's why it's vital to always play a {{ parthenon }} as quickly
    as possible. Always use your discard phase action. Any cards you discard can be brought back several times over with
    {{ ashur_tablets }}. {{ dreams_of_the_sphinx }} also helps in looking for a {{ parthenon }}.

    Your deck is very aggressive but it doesn't mean <em>you</em> need to be. Try to avoid situations where you spew
    threats all over the table without being able to follow up on them. This will only make unnecessarily many players
    gang up against you. On the other hand, never accept any superfluous damage from the crosstable. Try to offer your
    crosstable other options instead, and if they do not like your options, you can threaten them with your torpedoes
    ({{ tupdogs }}). If you make a threat, don't go back on it, or you'll soon run out of credibility.
