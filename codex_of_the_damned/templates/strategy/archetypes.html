    {% trans trimmed %}
    V:tES has been played for years, and this has given birth to a number of efficient decks archetypes.
    Given the multiplayer nature of the game, many archetypes are valid choices at the highest level,
    as the efficiency of a deck depends a lot on its table placement and on the negociations skills of the player.
    Even on the modern tournament scene, dozens of different archetypes are usually played in a single event.
    {% endtrans %}
</p>
<p>
    {% trans trimmed %}
    As such, having a basic understanding of the most common archetypes and their strong and weak points is
    a very important skill for a player. Knowing the inner workings of the archetypes on the table is the only way
    to fathom the table balance and detect the opportunities as they arise during the game.
    {% endtrans %}
</p>
<p>
    {% trans trimmed %}
    The archetypes are usually divided into broader categories, as presented here.
    {% endtrans %}
</p>

<h2 id="bleed">{{ _("Bleed") }}</h2>
<p>
    {% trans trimmed %}
    Bleed decks are focused on prey aggression and use bleed actions to inflict heavy pool damages.
    {{ dom }} is without question the most damage-heavy bleed discipline, plus it does come with bounce cards.
    {{ pre }} and {{ dem }} are good second choices.
    {% endtrans %}
</p>
<h3>{{ _("Stealth & Bleed and Powerbleed") }}</h3>
<p>
    {% trans trimmed %}
    There are two ways to get bleeds through: using <strong>stealth</strong> is the most obvious one.
    {{ obf }} is the best stealth discipline, but it does not often come along with {{ dom }}.
    {{ obt }} and {{ pro }} come second.
    {% endtrans %}
</p>

    {% trans trimmed

    pentex_subversion=card("Pentex™ Subversion"),
    misdirection=card("Misdirection"),
    anarch_troublemaker=card("Anarch Troublemaker")
    %}
    The other way to get bleeds through is to make sure the prey has no minion available to block the action.
    Along its strong bleed capabilities, {{ dom }} offers the excellent {{ seduction }}.
    {{ OBF }} {{ elder_impersonation }}, {{ NEC }} {{ call_of_the_hungry_dead }},
    {{ for }} {{ daring_the_dawn }} and {{ pre }} {{ mind_numb }} are also effective tools.
    Combining these options with the few Master cards that can prevent block or lock minions —
    {{ pentex_subversion }}, {{ misdirection }} and {{ anarch_troublemaker }} —
    makes stealth and intercept irrelevant.

<h3>{{ _("Highlights") }}</h3>
<p>
    {% trans trimmed %}
    Bleed decks have the <strong>highest prey damage</strong>. They tend to oust their first prey quite often,
    but it also attracts the table attention on them and one oust is not enough for a game win.
    They are usually <strong>weak in combat</strong>. They tend to rely on « combat ends » effects,
    but some flavours can have aggravated damage or torpor strikes as a threat.

        Stealth & Bleed archetypes have a strong stealth module, but it can jam the hand.
        If the prey assumes she will not have the means to block, she should decide not to attempt to block at all,
        and <strong>try to jam her predator hand on the stealth module</strong>.
        Well constructed Stealth & Bleed decks include some rotation tools to help with that.

    As they are focused on their prey, bleed decks have a weak defence against their predator

    Vote decks usually have a strong pool damage module to deliver to their prey.

    either breed and find a way to give votes to all your vampires, or use older vampires with titles themselves.

        as they can take down the minions of any Methusalah. Proper table control is
        essential to the succes of such builds, but it also opens a unique strategy for negociation:
        using the threat of combat to get things out of your neighbours.

<h3>{{ _("Highlights") }}</h3>
<p>
    {% trans trimmed %}
    Special decks tend to use complicated card combinations to a devastative effect. Their strength is in
    the <strong>absolute advantage</strong> their combination provides if all goes well. Their weakness
    is the frailty of such a combination. Blocking the right action or countering the right Master can often
    stop them dead in their tracks. Moreover, known combinations tend to attract the attention of all players,
    often leading the Methusalah to lose all its allies very early in the game.
