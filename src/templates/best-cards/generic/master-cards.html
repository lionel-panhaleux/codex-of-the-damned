    <p>
        Before its <em>errata</em> in september 2019, <em>Pentex</em> was played in over half of tournament
        decks
        and it was the most played card overall. It used to prevent the target minion from acting too,
        and that made it the most versatile card of the game.
        In the endgame its power is still worthwhile though: disabling a specific minion of the prey
        can be key to victory.

        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 1138 decks, typically 1-3 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Loved for its ubiquitousness, the <em>Dreams</em> provides either two pool
        (and can even accelerate the setup if played early) or help the deck rotation
        in critical moments by drawing two cards.

    </div>
    <p>
        Even if it is only once per game, it brings more blood on the table than any other card,
        with the notable exception of
        {{ card("Golconda: Inner Peace") }}.
        It is often played in a single copy: with a bit of luck it brings a definitive advantage,
        otherwise it prevents an opponent to play it himself.

        <h4>Vessel</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 868 decks, typically 2-4 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        The most played {{ link("/strategy/bloat", _("leeching"), _anchor="leeching") }} card,
        it is similar to {{ card("Blood Doll") }}.
        Both enable a 1 point leech per turn and allow to give some blood back to a thirsty vampire,
        which can avoid hunt actions and keep {{ link("/strategy/fundamentals", _("A&B"), _anchor="AB") }} high.
        <em>Vessel</em> cost is higher: it takes a full turn to kick in and costs 1 pool, making it 2 pool
        less efficient,
        but it cannot be destroyed and it is a <em>Trifle</em>.

    <p>
        Before its <em>errata</em> in 2018, it permitted to take back as much blood as desired
        from the target vampire with no upper limit. Its <em>Trifle</em> trait
        made it one of the best leech option, besting
        {{ card("Minion Tap") }}.
        The <em>errata</em> made {{ card("Minion Tap") }}
        relevant again, although only when getting more than 5 blood from a vampire is relevant.

    <p>
        The ability to cancel any minion card is extremely valuable.
        It has reliable role in {{ link("/strategy/archetypes", _("wall decks"), _anchor="wall") }}
        to deal with {{ link("/strategy/fundamentals", _("block denial"), _anchor="stealth-and-intercept") }},
        otherwise its value varies depending on how godd a player is at assessing the importance of cards.

    </div>
    <p>
        An excellent crypt accelerator at no cost, it is played both with big capacity crypts, but also with
        weenie crypts at 1-2 capacity to make it possible to draw and get out a vampire in a single turn.
        Even if it is <em>Unique</em>, some decks include it in multiple copies to improve their chances

    </div>
    <p>
        Similar to {{ card("Vessel") }} in its effect,
        it is not a <em>Trifle</em>, so it does not fit in all decks
        depending on the number of Master cards.
        Even if it can be destroyed by a {{ card("Vessel") }},
        it is immediately usable when played and costs zero pool.

        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 504 decks, typically 1 copy</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        A good bloat device that generates one pool per turn at no cost. It is a no-brainer in decks able to
        defend it. It can also be a useful piece of bargain when dealing with other Methusalahs, as it can
        easily be borrowed as part of a deal.

    </div>
    <p>
        A cheap <em>Trifle</em> that provides some rotation to the crypt. For a lot of crypts, this is a
        useful
        asset in the mid game to help fetch a third vampire. It is even guaranteed to
        generate one pool at some point.

    <p>
        A key card for combat heavy decks, usually used on the prey's minions, it provides excellent pool
        damage.
        The fact that it is <em>Unique</em> means it can not easily be abused, though.

    </div>
    <p>
        A dreadful deterrent against too powerful bleeders. A must have for decks who do not have access to
        bounces,
        it can be included in virtually any deck just to discourage the 6-7 bleed scores <i>d</i> and
        <i>r</i>

        Countering Master cards is often useful: the best move is to counter a bloat card like
        {{ card("Villein") }}, which is equivalent to a serious bleed.
        Other powerful Master cards can be countered this way too.

        A good way to bring back some blood on a vampire, it can also provide protection by blocking an
        action
        and is a key combination with {{ card("War Ghoul") }} and

        A useful tool as it enable the play of more Master cards at no cost, it can be combined with
        vampires
        providing yet another Master action: {{ card("Anson") }},
        {{ card("Nana Buruku") }},

    </div>
    <p>
        An easy way to get some pool back on a vampire at no cost.
        Many actions go through unblocked and unreacted to,
        so it tends to bring a pool back on the vampire at least every other turn.

    <p>
        One of the best tool available to bring some blood back on a vampire, it works beautifully with
        {{ card("Blood Doll") }} or
        {{ card("Vessel") }}. It needs to be defended to be kept in play,
        but such a good blood generator at no cost is a bargain.

    <p>
        A costly but efficient location. The stealth can make the difference between life or death
        for the prey, and the bonus hand size is nothing to frown upon.
        It is a little bit better in decks using
        {{ card("Parity Shift") }} as it can get the pool down just
        enough
        to be able to play the vote against one's prey.

    <p>
        Very similar to {{ card("Wash") }}, it is not a <em>Trifle</em>
        but,
        on the other hand, it does not let the target play another Master, so it is a bit more efficient
        for stopping a bloat. So, if there is room for a full fledged Master in the deck,
        it is a marginally better option.

        A good way to bring some blood back on the table, is it a useful tool against rush and grinder
        decks.
        Even if it does not come along so often, the fact that it helps the whole table can really slow down
        these

    </div>
    <p>
        It is a decent bloating device but its key ability is to allow some recursion in the deck.
        Played in conjunction with some cards to add Master action,
        it becomes tremendously efficient. Decks that use it typically include a dozen of them,
        but getting over 20 copies is not unheard of.

        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 287 decks, typically 1-2 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        A powerful tool for <em>powerbleed</em> constructs. Its ability to destroy an equipment can be
        useful,
        but it is mostly included for its ability to lock vampires, and it is a key card for bleed decks

        Although <em>Unique</em>, it is a solid counter against rush decks. Other options are required to
        really defend against them as this can only protect one vampire, but still this is a vampire one
        would not take down easily.

        This is a good damage dealing option for <em>wall</em> decks. As they tend to be low on pool damage,

        Although loosing a vampire is a steep price to pay, this is the highest bloat possible.
        Played on a 10 or 11 capacity vampire, that's a lot of pool, moreover if
        {{ card("Minion Tap") }}

        An excellent bloat device, its side-effect of card discard can be a bummer, as many

        An excellent device for combat-oriented decks. Broader than a rush action like

        target.
