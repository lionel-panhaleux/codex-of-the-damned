        {{ ani }} provide a strong long-range combat module and good intercept capabilities.
        Combined with {{ aus }}, it offers the best intercept in the game and access to the combo card
        {{ read_winds }}.

{% call layout.card_column('Carrion Crows', decks=252, copies="5-10") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
An excellent combat card. It is not a strike so it cannot be dodged,
it is harder to prevent and additional damage are still inflicted by the strike itself.
Moreover, it is ranged damage.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Cats' Guidance", decks=222, copies="2-5") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
A versatile defence tool providing either intercept or an unlock effect.
Not as surprising as a wake, but being unlocked can be better.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Canine Horde", decks=195, copies="1-3") %}
{% trans trimmed
	carrion_crows=card("Carrion Crows"),
	aid_from_bats=card("Aid from Bats")
%}
An excellent counter against weapons, it is often included in {{ ani }} combat modules.
Because {{ ani }} often uses {{ carrion_crows }}
and {{ aid_from_bats }} for a ranged combat module,
a ranged weapon on the opponent side is especially cumbersome.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Deep Song", decks=194, copies="3-10") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
The choice between bleed and rush gives it so much versatility,
it can be played in most table situations at an advantage.
The fact that the opponent has to choose his strike first is a nice bonus.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Raven Spy", decks=182, copies="2-6") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
A base building block for most {{ ani }} based intercept modules.
Permanent intercept is well worth the cost.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Sense the Savage Way", decks=167, copies="2-6") %}
{% trans trimmed
	eyes_argus=card("Eyes of Argus")
%}
Even if it is only available to big capacity vampires,
this is intercept and wake built in the same card,
a no-brainer if the deck has intercept options. It is even arguably better than {{ aus }}
{{ eyes_argus }},
as the intercept can be used on an undirected action.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Aid from Bats", decks=152, copies="6-14") %}
{% trans trimmed
	carrion_crows=card("Carrion Crows")
%}
The second pillar of {{ ani }} combat modules, it provides a maneuver, one damage, plus a welcome press,
either as a defensive tool to avoid a second round at close range, or as an offensive tool to
continue combat. Played multiple times in a row, it can take an opponent down
pretty fast. Coupled with a {{ carrion_crows }},
it delivers 6 damage with only two cards.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Army of Rats", decks=137, copies="1-2") %}
{% trans trimmed
	deep_song=card("Deep Song")
%}
{{ ani }} usually makes for excellent intercept and good combat,
but it may lack pool damage to fence off one’s prey,
with {{ deep_song }}
bringing only a bit of pool damage.
This is an excellent option to improve pool damage
if the deck has enough intercept capabilities to protect it.
