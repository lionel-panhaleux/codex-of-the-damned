<h1>{{ cel }} {{ _("Celerity") }}</h1>
<div class="tip">
    <p>
		{% trans trimmed %}
        {{ cel }} provides an excellent combat module.
        Its ability to manage range and deliver additional strikes is much appreciated.
        It also gives access to some of the best combo cards with {{ for }}, {{ ausÂ }}, {{ pre }} and {{ pro }}.
		{% endtrans %}
    </p>
</div>

{% call layout.card_column("Pursuit", decks=145, copies="3-8") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
The core of combat modules using {{ cel }}, it provides range control
with the option to deliver an additional strike instead.
The card is highly usable and does not jam the hand the way a simple maneuver would.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Forced March", decks=130, copies="2-7") %}
{% trans trimmed
	ab=link("/strategy/fundamentals", _("A&B"), _anchor="AB")
%}
An excellent modifier, even at inferior {{ cell }}{{ for }}: an unlock
at no cost is a very good {{ ab }} enhancer.
At superior, it can even provide a little bit of stealth
for a combination of disciplines that do not have much of it.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Blur", decks=115, copies="2-5") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
A serious enhancement for any combat module,
the ability to deliver not one but two additional strikes is unique to {{ cel }}.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Resist Earth's Grasp", decks=104, copies="2-6") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
Its 1 blood cost is balanced by the fact that it provides good combat options (maneuver, press)
along with a very rare stealth bonus at superior {{ CEL }}.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Psyche!", decks=102, copies="2-9") %}
{% trans trimmed
	sce=link("/strategy/combat", _("Strike: Combat End"), _anchor="defence")
%}
The ability to start a combat anew is one of the best counter
against {{ sce }} effects.
Only a few cards in the game provide this effect, so it is a real asset for {{ cel }} combat modules.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Sideslip", decks=83, copies="2-5") %}
{% trans trimmed
	pursuit=card("Pursuit"),
	sideslip=card("Sideslip"),
	acrobatics=card("Acrobatics")
%}
A versatile defensive tool, it is unlikely to jam a hand too much,
and the dodge or the damage prevention can save a vampire from a lethal blow.
{{ pursuit }} and {{ sideslip }} provide more options and versatility
at no cost than using {{ acrobatics }}, for example.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Quicken Sight", decks=63, copies="2-5") %}
{% trans trimmed %}
A good intercept reaction: +2 intercept bonus at superior {{ CEL }}{{ AUS }},
stackable with other {{ aus }} reactions, is already good enough.
The additional maneuver is a nice touch, as {{ cel }}{{ aus }} constructs
often use guns in their combat module.
{% endtrans %}
{% endcall %}

{% call layout.card_column("Side Strike", decks=55, copies="1-4") %}
{% trans trimmed
	pursuit=card("Pursuit"),
	blur=card("Blur")
%}
A versatile combat tool, its effect can be either defensive (dodge)
or offensive (additional strike) depending on the situation.
Although not as powerful as {{ pursuit }} or {{ blur }},
it is yet another source of additional strikes
that can let the vampire avoid problematic strikes from the opponent.
