    </div>
    <p>
        The damage-dealing vote <em>par excellence</em>.
        It does not depend on the table conditions and delivers a steady 3 pool blow to the prey.
        Often played in multiple copies in vote decks, it is key in finishing a table as it is the most
        certain way
        to deal pool damage in a duel or a three-way.

        <h4>Banishment</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 325 decks, typically 1-3 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        A very powerful vote when using big capacity vampires. It will cost time and pool to the target,
        most likely the prey or predator, but it can target anyone on the table,
        making it a nice tool for table control and deal making.

        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/card-images/reinsofpower.jpg') }}">
        <h4>Reins of Power</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 277 decks, typically 1 copy</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        A serious damage dealer when playing 10 or 11 capacity vampire.
        Only one copy is included but, with the right crypt,
        it is one of the strongest damage dealing votes.

<div class="column">

        <h4>Ancient Influence</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 250 decks, typically 1 copy</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        A customary companion to {{ card("Reins of Power") }},
        it is a good bloat device (for 5 or 6 pool), but may have to be discarded if the prey
        has big capacity vampires.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="column">
    <div class="column-image">
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/card-images/politicalstranglehold.jpg') }}">
        <h4>Political Stranglehold</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 235 decks, typically 1 copy</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Completing the triptych along {{ card("Reins of Power") }}
        and {{ card("Ancient Influence") }},
        it is a good bloat device if one plans to get two or more big capacity vampires into play.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="column">
    <div class="column-image">
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/card-images/anarchistuprising.jpg') }}">
        <h4>Anarchist Uprising</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 212 decks, typically 1 copy</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Almost always played along
        {{ card("Ancilla Empowerment") }},
        it is a decisive tool against weenie and breed decks. Depending on the situation,
        it can take a whole table down in a single strike.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="column">
    <div class="column-image">
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/card-images/ancillaempowerment.jpg') }}">
        <h4>Ancilla Empowerment</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 202 decks, typically 1 copy</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Almost always played along
        {{ card("Anarchist Uprising") }},
        it has the same effect. Having both can make a
        {{ card("Delaying Tactics") }} fizzle, so why not.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="column">
    <div class="column-image">
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/card-images/neonatebreach.jpg') }}">
        <h4>Neonate Breach</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 138 decks, typically 1-2 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Although not as certain as
        {{ card("Kine Resources Contested") }},
        it will work against most decks and it adds a little bit of variety to address the
        {{ card("Delaying Tactics") }} problem.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="column">
    <div class="column-image">
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/card-images/consanguineousboon.jpg') }}">
        <h4>Consanguineous Boon</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 107 decks, typically 2-8 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Although only worth it in breed decks, its bloat power is tremendous in this case.
        Political breed decks can usually get away with not defence at all,
        relying on this bloat device alone
        to survive even the most hard pressing predators.

<div class="column">
    <div class="column-image">
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/card-images/conservativeagitation.jpg') }}">

        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 98 decks, typically 1-4 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        A strong damage dealing vote in the beginning, it becomes frail in the end game
        once some players have been ousted. Still a solid alternative to add variety over
        {{ card("Kine Resources Contested") }} and
        dilute a potential {{ card("Delaying Tactics") }}.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="column">
    <div class="column-image">
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/card-images/domainchallenge.jpg') }}">
        <h4>Domain Challenge</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 85 decks, typically 1-2 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        A strong damage dealing vote against builds with many minions, it does offer a little bit more
        control
        than {{ card("Anarchist Uprising") }} and
        {{ card("Ancilla Empowerment") }},
        but will deal less damage. An option often favored by breed constructs themselves.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
        Although less common than pool-related votes, it gets often included
        as many locations can be worth the action to steal them. Of course, its efficency depends
        solely on the environment.
