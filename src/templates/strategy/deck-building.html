<h2 id="modules-and-density">Modules and density</h2>
<p>
    Decks can be broken down in « modules »: group of cards with a similar objective.
    The percentage of cards each module contains is its density. As the normal hand size is seven,
    the expectation (<em>ie.</em> the number of cards of the module you can expect in any given hand)
    is the density time seven.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Spam</strong> modules have a density over 25% entail an expectation over 1.75: more often than not,
    two cards of the module in hand. This is a rare distribution,
    but necessary to continuously play a given card multiple times every turn.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Strong</strong> modules have a density between 14% and 25% and an expectation between 1 and 1.5:
    these cards will be used once or twice at each turn.
    Most decks have one or multiple strong modules, and their strategy can often be identified by checking them.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Standard</strong> modules have a density between 7% and 14% have an expectation between ½ and 1.
    They are supposed to be used regularly but not necessarily every turn. Strong and standard modules cards
    can be discarded when needed, as one can be confident to get another in hand quite soon.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Tactical</strong> modules have a density below 7% and typically provide specific support.
    From unique permanents and events to counters or responses to expected counters, they provide build-up power
    and security. As these cards are drawn sporadically, they are meant to be kept in hand for special cases
    or immediately discarded if the context is not favourable. In case they might come in handy, they should be
    kept in hand until needed: the sparse distribution of the module makes sure the cards will not jam the hand.
</p>
<div class="tip">
    <h3>Master module</h3>
    <p>
        The Master module density depends on the rotation speed: one want to play one Master card per turn
        as much as possible, but not more. So the higher the rotation speed, the slimmer the master module density.
        Hence, the Master cards count stays stable across deck sizes: 12 to 15 Master cards plus, optionally,
        up to 6 or 7 Trifle.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some decks can use specific cards like {{ card("The Parthenon") }}
        to get more Master actions and hence play more Master cards in the deck, though:
        this is the
        <strong>M</strong>ulti <strong>M</strong>aster <strong>P</strong>hase <strong>A</strong>ctions (MMPA)
        strategy.
    </p>
</div>
<h2 id="rotation">Rotation</h2>
<p>
    Games usually last between 10 to 20 turns and decks are tailored with the peak card rotation speed in mind:
    the number of cards played on average between one unlock phase and the next,
    not counting the few first turns of build-up. The deck size should enable a peak rotation during 12 turns.
    The efficiency of a deck depends on its capacity to maintain an optimal rotation speed throughout the game:
    being stuck with no relevant card to play is a loosing situation.
</p>
<div class="tip">
    <h3>Deck size examples</h3>
    <p>
        60 cards deck have a peak rotation of 5 cards maximum (5 × 12 = 60): in the mid-game it plays one master,
        three to four minion cards, and maybe a discard. This counts the whole turn, reactions included.
    </p>
    <p>
        90 cards deck have a peak rotation of 7 to 8 cards (90 ∕ 12 = 7.5): in the mid-game it plays one master,
        up to a full hand of minion cards and maybe a discard.
    </p>
</div>
<p>
    <strong>Cycling</strong> cards and purposefully increasing the rotation to get more efficient cards
    is sometimes the only way to keep the rotation fluid.
    Multiple cards are available to provide good cycling options:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
		{{ card("Dreams of the Sphinx") }}
	</li>
    <li>
		{{ card("The Barrens") }}
	</li>
    <li>
		{{ card("Heart of Nizchetus") }}
	</li>
    <li>
        {{ card("Fragment of the Book of Nod") }}
        (need to be defended)
    </li>
    <li>
        {{ card("Powerbase: Los Angeles") }}
        (need to be defended, best with Anarchs)
    </li>
    <li>
        {{ card("The Admonitions") }}
        (Sabbat only, best with Black Hand)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    A card that is hard to play can <strong>jam</strong> the hand.
    Action modifiers, especially restricted stealth cards like
    {{ card("Forgotten Labyrinth") }},
    can only be used when the opponent tries to block, so they can jam.
    On the other hand, action cards like
    {{ card("Computer Hacking") }}
    do not usually jam the hand as they can be played as soon as a minion is unlocked and ready to act.
    A tactical module for card rotation can be played in situations when jamming is expected.
</p>
<div class="tip">
    <h3>Recursion</h3>
    <p>
        Even stronger than a good rotation, the <strong>recursion</strong> can be a strong point in a deck:
        it is the ability to fetch cards from the ash heap and get them back into hand.
        Only a few cards provide recursion:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            {{ card("Ashur Tablets") }} provide an excellent
            recursion as well as a powerful bloat. They need more than one Master phase action to be really
            effective, so {{ card("The Parthenon") }} can come in
            handy. The MMPA archetypes like {{ link("/archetypes/girls-will-find-inner-circle") }}
            make full use of this card.
        </li>
        <li>
            {{ card("The Sargon Fragment") }} is the only
            other option open to all, but it is unique and uses up a lot of actions.
        <li>
            <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='/img/icons/clan-giovanni.svg') }}"> have the excellent
            {{ card("Sudario Refraction") }} and the lesser
            {{ card("Spiritual Guidance") }}
        </li>
        <li>
            <i>n</i> offers
            {{ card("Whispers From the Dead") }} and
            {{ card("Gear Up") }} (Anarchs)
        </li>
        <li>
            {{ card("Garibaldi-Meucci Museum") }}
            (Unique, Anarchs)
        </li>
        <li>
            {{ card("Drop Point Network") }}
            (Black Hand)
        </li>
        <li>
            {{ card("Maabara") }} (<img
                src="{{ url_for('static', filename='/img/icons/clan-harbingers.svg') }}">)
        </li>
        <li>
            {{ card("Unity") }}
            (<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='/img/icons/creed-visionary.svg') }}">)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Beyond its obious advantage of fetching just the right card at the right time, a good recursion allows
        a deck to adapt itself to the context and the table situation.
    </p>
</div>
<h2 id="building-a-deck">Building a deck in practice</h2>
<h3>1. Theme</h3>
<p>
    The first step to build a deck is to choose a theme, a core principle to build upon.
    Multiple possibilities here:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Clan</strong>: the most common theme, just choose a clan.</li>
    <li><strong>Discipline(s)</strong>: choose one or more disciplines you want to play.</li>
    <li><strong>Star</strong>: choose a star vampire with powerful disciplines or abilities.</li>
    <li><strong>Cards combination</strong>: choose a combination of two to four cards you want to play together.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>2. Four strategic pillars</h3>
<p>
    The second step, before adding more cards to the deck, is to define the four pillars of the deck strategy:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Payload:</strong> how the deck delivers pool damage to its prey.
        Does it {{ link("/strategy/fundamentals", _("bleed"), _anchor="bleed") }}?
        Use {{ link("/strategy/fundamentals", _("politics"), _anchor="politics") }}?
        Some other pool damage device like
        {{ card("Anarch Revolt") }} or
        {{ card("Dragonbound") }}?
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Delivery system:</strong> how the deck makes sure the payload is delivered.
        If it bleeds, does it use stealth, block denial or an overwhelming number of actions?
        If it uses political actions, does it use stealth to get them through? How does it get enough votes?
        If it uses specific pool damage cards, do they need protection or support to apply their effect?
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Defense:</strong> how the deck avoids to lose.
        {{ link("/strategy/bloat", _("Bloating"), _anchor="bloat") }} is the most generic defense:
        gaining pool works against all offensive strategies. Most decks use a modicum of bloat,
        some rely on a heavy bloat as their sole defense.
        <em>Blocking</em> is the second most generic defense: most offensive strategies use actions.
        More focused defensive tools are often used against the most widespread offensive strategies:
        {{ link("/strategy/fundamentals", _("Bounces"), _anchor="bounce") }} or
        <em>Reduction</em> against bleed,
        {{ card("Delaying Tactics") }} and
        {{ card("Poison Pill") }}
        against politics.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Combat Management:</strong> how the deck deals with minion combats.
        If it does not plan to block, <em>support allies</em> to block rush actions can be enough.
        Some decks plan to avoid combat and use
        {{ link("/strategy/combat", _("combat ends"), _anchor="defense") }} effects when it cannot be avoided.
        Others plan to use combats to optimize {{ link("/strategy/combat", _("bruise"), _anchor="bruise") }}
        in their favor.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>3. Cards</h3>
<p>
    Now select the crypt and library cards to put in the deck.
    The minions you select will define the range of disciplines you can use and,
    symmetrically, the library cards you choose and their requirements will define what minions you want in your crypt.
</p>
<p>
    During this card selection process, only add <strong>one copy of each card</strong> you want to play.
    Check the {{ link("/best-cards", _("best cards")) }} and the
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("deck archive")) }} for ideas.
    If you find tournament winning examples close to your deck list, they may give you ideas about what to include.
</p>
<p>
    At the end you should have <strong>4 to 12 crypt cards and 20 to 40 library cards</strong>.
    If you have more, it is time to sit back and ponder what is really useful and what should be cut.
    Consider your four strategic pillars to help you decide:
    payload is more important than delivery, itself more important than defense, and combat management comes last.
</p>
<p class=subtitle>
    Note at this point you are working in single copies. This means that if you are building a rush combat deck,
    you should consider removing combat cards before removing a payload card like
    {{ card("Fame") }}.
    When adjusting the number of copies on the other hand, no pillar has priority and you may choose
    to use dozens of copies of the combat cards you kept in the selection and a single
    {{ card("Fame") }}.
</p>
<div class="tip">
    <h3>Counters</h3>
    <p>
        If you can predict that specific archetypes will be a threat, consider including
        specific counters against them. From {{ card("Fear of Mekhet") }}
        against Inner Circles to
        {{ card("Scourge of the Enochians") }} against swarms,
        including {{ card("Archon Investigation") }}
        against greedy bleeders, there are a lot of options available and
        they can transform a losing position into a win.
    </p>
    <p>
        If nothing specific comes in mind, consider the all-purpose counters of the game:
        {{ card("Direct Intervention") }},
        {{ card("Dark Influences") }},
        {{ card("Sudden Reversal") }} or
        {{ card("Wash") }}.
    </p>
</div>
<h3>4. Card flow</h3>
<p>
    Once the skeleton is ready, you can adjust the card flow. First adjust the crypt:
    use 4 (or more) copies for a star, 3 copies for an especially good minion if he is not mandatory for your play,
    2 copies for an efficient one and 1 copy for support minions.
</p>
<p>
    Then try to get an idea of the <a href="#rotation">rotation speed</a>:
    what would a normal turn be in the mid-game (including reactions)?
    How many minions are acting and reacting and how many cards are used?
    This will give you the target library size as well as the number of cards you need in each of your modules.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, define <a href="#modules-and-density">modules and their density</a> and adapt the number of copies
    in each of them to match the desired density, working module by module.
    Adjusting the master module first may be easier, as its density only depends
    on the number of master actions you expect to get.
    For the rest of the deck though, there is no predefined pattern:
    no strategic pillar has the priority in terms of density.
    A <em>Stealth & Bleed</em> can typically have two strong module for bleed and stealth,
    two standard modules for bounce and combat defense, and a tactical module against politics. A <em>Wall</em>
    deck, on the other hand, can have a spam module for wake & intercept,
    a standard module for bloat and only a tactical module for the payload.
</p>
<p>
    This little calculator may help you figure out the number of copies you want to include for each card:
</p>
<form class="inline-form" id="stat-form-at-least" autocomplete="off"
    oninput="aL0_result.value = Math.round(atLeastOne(parseInt(aL0_stack.value), parseInt(aL0_copies.value), parseInt(aL0_draws.value)) * 10000) / 100+ ' %'">

    oninput="hMN_result.value = howManyNeeded(parseInt(hMN_stack.value), parseInt(hMN_draws.value), parseFloat(hMN_expectation.value) / 100) + ' copies'">

        <label for="hMN_draws">draws:</label>

        <label for="hMN_expectation">desired probability (%):</label>

    </fieldset>
</form>
<p class=subtitle>
    The probability to get a specific card is computed as the cumulated probability (sum) of having 1, 2, ..., n
    copies of the card.
    <br />
    The formula used is \(\sum_{i=1}^{\min\left(d,c\right)}\ \frac{\binom{c}{i}\binom{s-c}{d-i}}{\binom{s}{d}}\),
    with s: stack, d: draws and c: copies and \(\binom{n}{k}\) the binomial coefficients.
    <br />
    To second computation just computes the preceding probability for consecutive values of c.
</p>
<div class="tip">
    <h3>Cycling</h3>
    <p>
        If one of your strong module can jam your hand (for example a strong stealth or a strong intercept module),
        consider adding cycling-oriented cards (<em>cf.</em> the <a href="#rotation">Rotation</a> section).
    </p>
    <p>
        They should not be included blindly though; they can be an obstacle to a deck with no jam issue.
    </p>
</div>
<h3>5. Test and refine</h3>
<p>
    Once the first version of the deck list is ready, it should be tested to check if it behaves as expected.
    Just doing a dozen play simulations alone, playing out the first 3 to 5 turns with no opponents, can help
    you adapt the card flow a bit.
    If you have some time at hand, you can use the
    <a target="_blank" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='pdf/play-test-system.pdf') }}">play test system</a> devised
    by <em>Paul Johnson</em>
    to test your deck more thoroughly.
</p>
<p>
    In the end, only real games can help refine a deck. Actual play get you accustomed to a
    deck strengths and weaknesses. It helps to note the cards cycled or discarded during a game:
    each card you do not use is a card you should consider removing.
